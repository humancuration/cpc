# Flood Fill Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the flood fill algorithm for the Magic Wand tool.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Selection System (`apps/art/src/core/selection.rs`)

- Implemented scanline flood fill algorithm in `SelectionArea::new_magic_wand`
- Added `contiguous` parameter to function signature
- Implemented tolerance-based color matching
- Added Rayon parallel processing for large images (non-contiguous mode)
- Added helper functions:
  - `get_pixel_color`: Extract RGBA values from pixel data
  - `color_match`: Compare colors with tolerance using Euclidean distance
  - `find_left_bound` and `find_right_bound`: Find scanline boundaries
  - `check_neighbor`: Enqueue valid neighbor pixels
- Added comprehensive unit tests
- Added benchmark tests for performance

### 2. Selection Service (`apps/art/src/core/selection.rs`)

- Updated `SelectionService::create_magic_wand_selection` to pass contiguous parameter

### 3. Magic Wand Tool (`apps/art/src/tools/selection/magic_wand.rs`)

- Updated `handle_press` to pass contiguous parameter to SelectionService
- Verified existing `set_contiguous` method works correctly

### 4. Dependencies (`apps/art/Cargo.toml`)

- Added `rayon = "1.7"` for parallel processing

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Scanline Flood Fill Algorithm**: Efficient algorithm that processes horizontal runs of pixels
2. **Contiguous Selection**: Traditional magic wand behavior that selects connected regions
3. **Non-contiguous Selection**: Selects all matching pixels regardless of connectivity
4. **Tolerance-based Matching**: Configurable color similarity threshold (0.0-1.0)
5. **Parallel Processing**: Rayon-based parallel processing for large non-contiguous selections
6. **Performance Optimizations**: 
   - Early exit for out-of-bounds coordinates
   - Efficient visited pixel tracking
   - Chunked processing for large images
7. **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for all new functionality
8. **Benchmark Tests**: Performance tests to ensure algorithm efficiency

## Algorithm Details

### Contiguous Mode (Scanline Flood Fill)
1. Start from clicked pixel
2. Find left and right bounds of current scanline
3. Mark all pixels in scanline as selected
4. Check pixels above and below the scanline
5. Enqueue valid neighbors for processing
6. Repeat until queue is empty

### Non-contiguous Mode
1. Check all pixels in layer
2. Select pixels that match target color within tolerance
3. Use parallel processing for large images (>1M pixels)

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Color matching with various tolerances
- Pixel color extraction
- Boundary detection
- Contiguous selection behavior
- Non-contiguous selection behavior

### Benchmark Tests
- Performance testing for contiguous selections (1000x1000 pixels)
- Performance testing for non-contiguous selections (500x500 pixels)

## Performance Characteristics

- Contiguous selections: O(n) time complexity where n is the number of selected pixels
- Non-contiguous selections: O(w*h) time complexity where w and h are image dimensions
- Memory usage: O(w*h) for mask and visited arrays
- Parallel processing for non-contiguous selections on large images
