# Tool Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the selection and transform tools for the Art application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Selection System (`apps/art/src/core/selection.rs`)

- Added `id: Uuid` field to `SelectionArea` struct
- Updated all `SelectionArea` constructors to generate unique IDs
- Enhanced documentation for the struct

### 2. Rectangle Selection Tool (`apps/art/src/tools/selection/rectangle.rs`)

- Implemented proper selection creation using `SelectionService`
- Added undo/redo support with `SelectionCreated` actions
- Improved documentation

### 3. Lasso Selection Tool (`apps/art/src/tools/selection/lasso.rs`)

- Implemented point collection during drag operations
- Added point simplification using Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm
- Implemented proper selection creation using `SelectionService`
- Added undo/redo support with `SelectionCreated` actions
- Enhanced documentation
- Added unit tests for point simplification algorithms

### 4. Magic Wand Tool (`apps/art/src/tools/selection/magic_wand.rs`)

- Implemented click-based selection creation
- Integrated with `SelectionService` for proper selection creation
- Added undo/redo support with `SelectionCreated` actions
- Enhanced documentation

### 5. Move Transform Tool (`apps/art/src/tools/transform/move_tool.rs`)

- Implemented both layer and selection movement
- Added constrained movement support (simulated)
- Integrated with `TransformService` for proper transformations
- Added undo/redo support with `LayerTransformed` and `SelectionModified` actions
- Enhanced documentation

## Key Features Implemented

1. **UUID Integration**: All selections now have unique identifiers for tracking
2. **Proper Action Generation**: All tools generate appropriate undo/redo actions
3. **Service Integration**: Tools properly use SelectionService and TransformService
4. **Algorithm Implementation**: 
   - Point simplification for lasso tool
   - Point-to-line distance calculation
   - Ramer-Douglas-Peucker line simplification
5. **Unit Tests**: Added tests for core algorithms
6. **Documentation**: Enhanced documentation for all public interfaces

## Testing

Unit tests were added for the lasso tool's point simplification algorithms, verifying:
- Point simplification with few points
- Point simplification with collinear points
- Point-to-line distance calculations

## Future Improvements

1. Implement proper flood fill algorithm for Magic Wand tool
2. Add worker thread support for large operations
3. Implement snap-to-grid functionality
4. Add shift+click expansion for Magic Wand
5. Improve hit testing for layer selection in Move tool
