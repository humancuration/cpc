# Document Editor Refactor Summary

This document summarizes the refactor of the document_editor app to use the collaboration_engine package for real-time editing, conflict resolution, and presence tracking.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependency Update
- Added `collaboration_engine = { path = "../../shared_packages/collaboration_engine" }` to Cargo.toml

### 2. Domain Operations Extension
- Extended the DocumentOperation enum in `src/crdt/operations.rs` to include:
  - Format operation with range and format type
  - InsertImage operation with position, image_id, and caption
- Added FormatType enum for different formatting options

### 3. Collaboration Service Refactor
- Updated `src/application/collaboration_service.rs` to use collaboration_engine components:
  - Replaced old CRDT implementation with SyncManager that uses ConflictResolver and PresenceManager
  - Added apply_operation method for handling document operations
  - Added update_presence method for tracking user presence
  - Added get_presences method for retrieving user presences
  - Added set_user_priority method for conflict resolution priority

### 4. Operation Conversion
- Created `src/collaboration/conversion.rs` for bidirectional conversion between DocumentOperation and collaboration_engine Operation types:
  - Handles all operation types including Format and InsertImage
  - Uses From/Into traits for clean conversion

### 5. Real-time Synchronization
- Created `src/collaboration/sync.rs` for real-time synchronization with collaboration_engine:
  - Implements SyncManager for managing document operations and user presence
  - Integrates with conflict resolution and presence tracking

### 6. UI Updates
- Updated `src/presentation/editor.rs` to display presence indicators:
  - Added imports for collaboration_engine types
  - Added presences state management
  - Added view_presence_indicators function to render user cursors with QoS coloring
  - Added typing indicators

### 7. Export Service Updates
- Updated `src/infrastructure/pdf_exporter.rs` to handle formatting:
  - Enhanced to_pdf function that processes operations and applies formatting
  - Added handling for all Format operations (bold, italic, underline, list items)
  - Added support for InsertImage operations
  - Uses appropriate fonts for different formatting styles

### 8. Testing
- Added `tests/conversion_tests.rs` for unit tests of operation conversion logic
- Added `tests/sync_integration.rs` for integration tests of real-time sync

### 9. Deprecation Notices
- Added deprecation comments to all files in the old CRDT and collaboration implementations:
  - `src/crdt/` directory files
  - `src/collaboration/` directory files
  - `src/collaboration/transport/` directory files
- Created `src/crdt/README.md` to document the deprecation

## Implementation Notes

The refactor focused on integrating the collaboration_engine while maintaining backward compatibility where possible. The new implementation provides:

1. Real-time editing capabilities through the collaboration_engine's core components
2. Conflict resolution using the ConflictResolver
3. Presence tracking using the PresenceManager
4. Extended operations model to support formatting and image insertion
5. UI updates to show user presence indicators with QoS information
6. Export functionality that handles formatting operations
7. Comprehensive testing for conversion and synchronization logic

The old CRDT and collaboration implementations have been marked as deprecated but retained for reference during the transition.
