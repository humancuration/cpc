# Sheets Application Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Sheets application for the CPC platform. The Sheets app is a collaborative spreadsheet tool that integrates with the BI Visualization Toolkit and provides real-time collaboration features.

## Implementation Status

✅ **Completed**: Full implementation of the Sheets application according to architectural specifications.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Domain Layer
- **Sheet**: Main spreadsheet container with permissions management
- **Cell**: Individual cell with value, formatting, and CRDT support
- **Formula**: Formula evaluation with dependency tracking
- **ChartSpec**: Chart configuration for data visualization
- **CRDT Support**: Conflict-free replicated data types for collaborative editing

### 2. Application Layer
- **SheetService**: Sheet management and CRUD operations
- **FormulaEvaluator**: Formula evaluation engine (SUM, AVERAGE, etc.)
- **ChartService**: Chart generation using BI Visualization Toolkit
- **CollaborationService**: Real-time collaboration with event broadcasting

### 3. Infrastructure Layer
- **Storage**: Database models and repository implementation
- **Event Bus**: Collaboration event handling
- **BI Visualization**: Chart generation integration
- **Import/Export**: XLSX and CSV parsers

### 4. Presentation Layer
- **Web Routes**: REST API endpoints
- **GraphQL**: GraphQL schema for sheet operations

### 5. Database Migrations
- Complete schema for sheets, cells, formulas, charts, permissions, and collaboration

## Features Implemented

✅ Real-time collaborative editing with CRDTs
✅ Formula evaluation engine
✅ Chart generation using BI Visualization Toolkit
✅ XLSX and CSV import/export
✅ Permission management
✅ Version history
✅ Event-driven architecture

## Integration Points

### BI Visualization Toolkit
- Direct integration for chart generation
- Interactive chart support via Bevy

### Event Bus
- Real-time collaboration events
- Cursor tracking and presence
- Sheet sharing notifications

### Storage Abstraction
- Differential saving for collaboration
- Standardized repository interface

## Testing

Unit tests are included for all core components:
- Domain model validation
- Formula evaluation
- Chart generation
- CRDT merge operations
- Import/export validation

## Next Steps

1. **UI Implementation**: Create web-based spreadsheet interface
2. **Advanced Formulas**: Implement more complex formula functions
3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize for large spreadsheets
4. **Mobile Support**: Android and iOS implementations
5. **Advanced Charts**: Additional chart types and customization options

## Deployment

The Sheets application is ready for integration into the CPC platform and follows all architectural guidelines:
- Hexagonal architecture
- Vertical slices
- screaming architecture
- Standard integration patterns with core modules
