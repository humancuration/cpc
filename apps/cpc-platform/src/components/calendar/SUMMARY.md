# Calendar UI Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the calendar UI components as specified in the task.

## Completed Components

### 1. Core Components

#### EventCard (`cards/event_card.rs`)
- Implemented with all specified props from ARCHITECTURE_UI.md
- Privacy indicators (üîí, üë•, üåê, ü§ù) based on EventVisibility
- EventType color-coded badges
- Recurring event indicator (‚Üª)
- Geofence visualization when location.radius exists
- Touch-friendly controls (48x48px minimum targets)

#### CalendarStore (`state/store.rs`)
- Implementation using Yew Context API
- Follows the CalendarState and CalendarAction definitions from ARCHITECTURE_UI.md
- Proper handling for recurring events (expand recurrence rules)
- Vector clock tracking for conflict resolution

#### CalendarViewSwitcher (`views/switcher.rs`)
- Responsive layout handling (mobile/desktop variants)
- View preservation when switching between Month/Week/Day/Shift
- Date navigation controls

### 2. GraphQL Integration (`api/calendar.rs`)
- `fetch_events` function matching the pattern in ARCHITECTURE_UI.md
- `setup_realtime_sync` function with reconnection logic and error handling
- Proper error handling and vector clock extraction

### 3. Utility Functions (`utils/`)

#### Conflict Resolution (`utils/sync.rs`)
- `resolve_conflict()` with options from ARCHITECTURE_UI.md
- Visual diff generator for conflicting events

#### Touch Handling (`utils/touch.rs`)
- Swipe navigation for date changes
- Long press detection for context menus
- Haptic feedback for drag operations

#### Recurrence Formatting (`utils/format_recurrence.rs`)
- Format recurrence rules into human-readable strings

### 4. Mobile-Specific Implementation (`src-tauri/src/calendar.rs`)
- `get_current_position` implementation
- `request_shift_swap` for mobile-optimized shift swap
- Registered with Tauri invoke handler

### 5. Responsive Design (`styles.css`)
- CSS modules for responsive breakpoints (<600px, 600-960px, >960px)
- Virtualized scrolling for event lists on mobile
- Compact event card layout per mobile mockups in ARCHITECTURE_UI.md

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- CalendarStore state transitions (`state/store_test.rs`)
- Recurrence rule expansion (`utils/format_recurrence_test.rs`)
- Conflict resolution logic (`utils/sync.rs`)

### Integration Tests
- GraphQL data fetching (`api/calendar.rs`)
- Real-time subscription handling (stubbed in `api/calendar.rs`)
- Mobile gesture recognition (`utils/touch.rs`)

## Architecture Compliance

This implementation follows the vertical slice architecture by:
- Connecting UI components directly to domain models
- Using well-defined GraphQL interfaces
- Maintaining separation of concerns
- Following hexagonal architecture principles

## Mobile Optimization

All components are optimized for mobile devices:
- Touch-friendly controls with minimum 48x48px targets
- Responsive layout that adapts to screen size
- Performance optimizations for mobile devices
- Native integration through Tauri commands

## Privacy Visualization

All privacy requirements are implemented:
- Correct privacy indicators for all EventVisibility levels
- Color coding for EventType (Personal=blue, Business=green, etc.)
- Geofencing visualization when applicable

## Recurring Events

Recurring event handling is implemented:
- Recurrence rule expansion in CalendarStore
- Visual indication of recurring events in EventCard
- Human-readable recurrence text display
