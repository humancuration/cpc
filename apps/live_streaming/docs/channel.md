# Channel Management

This document describes the channel management system in the Live Streaming module.

## Overview

The channel management system allows users to create, customize, and manage their streaming channels. It provides tools for personalization, analytics, and community building.

## Architecture

The channel system consists of:

1. **Channel Creation**: Setting up new streaming channels
2. **Channel Customization**: Personalizing channel appearance and settings
3. **Channel Management**: Ongoing administration and analytics
4. **Integration**: Connection with other module systems

## Implementation

### Channel Model

Location: `src/channel/channel.rs`

The channel model represents a user's streaming presence:

- Channel identity and branding
- Settings and preferences
- Statistics and analytics
- Custom emotes and content

Key components:
- `Channel`: Main channel entity
- `ChannelSettings`: Configuration options

- `CustomEmote`: Channel-specific emotes

### Channel Manager

Location: `src/channel/manager.rs`

The channel manager handles channel operations:

- Creation and initialization
- Updates and modifications
- Retrieval and search
- Statistics management

Key methods:
- `create_channel()`: Create new channel
- `get_channel()`: Retrieve channel by ID

let channel = channel_manager.create_channel(
    owner_id,
    name,
    description
).await?;
```

### Channel Updates

```rust
// Update channel information
channel_manager.update_channel_info(
    channel_id,
    Some(new_name),
    Some(new_description)
).await?;

// Update channel settings
channel_manager.update_channel_settings(
    channel_id,
    new_settings
).await?;
```
