- Dependency injection for core services
- Mock repository implementations for demonstration
- gRPC server startup
- Tauri desktop application initialization

### 2. Configuration

#### `Cargo.toml`
- Dependencies on cpay_core, notification_core, social_integration, and wallet
- Tauri build dependencies
- Workspace configuration

#### `tauri.conf.json`
- Tauri application configuration
- Window settings and sizing
- Security configuration
- Bundle settings for distribution

### 3. User Interface

#### `ui/index.html`
- Basic payment form with recipient, amount, and currency selection
- Transaction history display
- Simple JavaScript for form handling and mock transaction processing
- Responsive design with clean styling

### 4. Documentation

#### `README.md`
- Overview of the CPay application
- Feature list
- Architecture description
- Development instructions
