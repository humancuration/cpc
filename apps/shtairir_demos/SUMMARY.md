This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Shtairir demo applications implementation,
explaining how they demonstrate the power and flexibility of the Shtairir visual programming system.

## Project Overview

We have implemented three real-world example applications that showcase different aspects of
the Shtairir system:

- Implements statistical analysis using standard library blocks
- Generates human-readable reports
- Includes performance metrics collection

**Components Used:**
- `collection.map` for data transformation
- `collection.filter` for outlier removal
- `math.mean` for statistical analysis

- `collection.reduce` for counting operations

### 2. User Profile Management Workflow
A workflow for managing user profile data with validation and transformation.

**Key Features:**
- Demonstrates data validation patterns
- Shows string manipulation and normalization
- Implements data transformation pipelines
- Handles both valid and invalid data scenarios
- Tracks processing throughput metrics

**Components Used:**
- `string.trim` and `string.format` for data normalization

- `collection.random_sample` for data splitting
- `collection.stats_summary` for quality checks

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

Each example follows a consistent architectural pattern:

1. **Module Definition** (`MODULE.toml`)
   - Defines the Shtairir module with metadata
   - Lists block and graph specifications
   - Specifies version and compatibility requirements

2. **Block Specifications** (`blocks/*.toml`)
   - Custom blocks extending standard library functionality
   - TOML-based interface definitions
   - Type signatures and documentation

3. **Graph Specifications** (`graphs/*.toml`)
   - Visual workflow definitions using TOML
   - Node and edge connections
   - Function definitions for complex operations
   - Input/output mappings

4. **Rust Implementation** (`src/*.rs`)
   - Programmatic execution of graphs
   - Integration with Shtairir runtime
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Error handling and logging

5. **Testing** (`tests/*.rs`)
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for complete workflows
   - Execution tests for validation

### Key Design Patterns

#### Graph Composition
All examples demonstrate how to compose standard library blocks into complex workflows:

```toml
# Example from data_processing/graphs/sensor_data_pipeline.toml
[[nodes]]
id = "map_transform"
kind = "block"
fq_block = "stdlib.shtairir/collection.map"
version_req = "^0.1"
title = "Transform Readings"

[nodes.inputs]
function = { ref = "transform_function" }
```

#### Function Definitions
Complex operations are defined as inline functions:

```toml
[functions]
transform_function = '''
fn transform(reading) -> object {
  // Add a processed timestamp and normalize data
  return {
    "id": reading.id,
    "timestamp": reading.timestamp,
    "processed_at": now(),
    "temperature": reading.temperature,
    "humidity": reading.humidity,
    "location": reading.location
  }
}
'''
```

#### Error Handling
Examples demonstrate proper error handling patterns:

```rust
match pipeline::execute_pipeline(&registry, reading_count).await {
    Ok(report) => {
        // Handle success case
        info!("Pipeline execution successful");
        println!("{}", report);
    }
    Err(e) => {
        // Handle error case
        warn!("Pipeline execution failed: {}", e);
        return Err(e);
    }
}
```

#### Performance Monitoring
All examples include performance metrics collection:

```rust
// Create a metrics collector
let mut metrics_collector = metrics::MetricsCollector::new();

// Record operation timing
let start = metrics_collector.start_operation();
// ... perform operation ...
metrics_collector.end_operation(start);

// Report statistics
let (min, avg, max) = metrics_collector.processing_time_stats();
println!("Processing time (min/avg/max): {:.2}ms / {:.2}ms / {:.2}ms", min, avg, max);
```

## Integration with CPC Ecosystem

### Dependencies
Examples use standard CPC workspace dependencies:

- **tokio**: Asynchronous runtime
- **serde**: Serialization framework
- **tracing**: Logging and instrumentation
- **rand**: Random number generation
