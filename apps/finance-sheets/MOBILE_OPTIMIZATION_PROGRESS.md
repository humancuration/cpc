### Responsive Layout Structure
- [x] Modified `apps/finance-sheets/src/app.rs` to split into MobileLayout/DesktopLayout components
- [x] Implemented device-size-based rendering
- [x] Created `apps/finance-sheets/src/components/mobile.rs` with layout components
- [x] Implemented NavigationRail component
- [x] Created BottomNavigation component
- [x] Added FloatingActionButton implementation

### Mobile-First Styling System

- [x] Updated all components to use relative units
- [x] Implemented mobile breakpoint handling
- [x] Created `apps/finance-sheets/src/styles.rs`
- [x] Defined utility functions for mobile styles

## Phase 2: Core Mobile Experience (COMPLETE)

### Touch-Optimized Spreadsheet Grid
- [x] Created `apps/finance-sheets/src/components/mobile/sheet_grid.rs`
- [x] Implemented MobileSheetGrid component
- [x] Ensured 48px minimum touch targets
- [x] Added visual feedback for cell selection

### Gesture System
- [x] Created `apps/finance-sheets/src/components/mobile/gesture_detector.rs`
- [x] Implemented swipe navigation between sheets
- [x] Added tap-and-hold context menu
- [x] Integrated with mobile components

### Mobile Toolbar System
- [x] Created `apps/finance-sheets/src/components/mobile/toolbar.rs`
- [x] Implemented context-aware action bar
- [x] Designed simplified mobile controls

### Optimize Existing Components
- [x] Modified `apps/finance-sheets/src/components/currency/currency_selector.rs`
- [x] Increased touch targets
- [x] Implemented mobile-specific dropdown behavior
- [x] Created `apps/finance-sheets/src/components/mobile/search_dropdown.rs`
- [x] Full-screen implementation for mobile
- [x] Keyboard optimization

## Phase 3: Offline & Performance (COMPLETE)

### Storage System
- [x] Created `apps/finance-sheets/src/services/mobile/storage.rs`
- [x] Implemented StorageAdapter trait
- [x] Android-specific implementation
- [x] Added local storage for active spreadsheets

### Sync System
- [x] Created `apps/finance-sheets/src/services/mobile/sync.rs`
- [x] Implemented SyncQueue
- [x] Added conflict resolution framework

### Performance Optimizations
- [x] Created `apps/finance-sheets/src/components/mobile/virtual_scroll.rs`
- [x] Implemented virtual scrolling for large sheets
- [x] Created `apps/finance-sheets/src/services/mobile/performance.rs`
- [x] Added memory management features

## Phase 4: Testing & Polish (IN PROGRESS)

### Device-Specific Testing
- [x] Created unit tests for mobile services
- [x] Created integration tests for mobile components
- [ ] Set up test harness for Android devices
- [ ] Implement performance benchmarking

### Polish Tasks
- [ ] Add haptic feedback for key interactions
- [ ] Final accessibility review

## Technical Constraints Met

- [x] Maintained Rust core functionality
- [x] Followed hexagonal architecture principles
- [x] Used Tauri 2.0 for mobile wrappers (web-based for now)
- [x] Kept Android implementation in Kotlin only for the thin wrapper layer

## Implementation Status

The core mobile optimization implementation is now complete! ðŸŽ‰

All major features have been implemented and are functional:
- Responsive design with device-specific layouts
- Touch-optimized UI components
- Gesture detection and handling
- Offline storage with sync capabilities
- Performance optimizations for mobile devices

See [MOBILE_OPTIMIZATION_COMPLETED.md](MOBILE_OPTIMIZATION_COMPLETED.md) for a complete summary of the implementation.

## Next Steps

1. Complete device-specific testing on physical Android devices
2. Implement haptic feedback for key interactions
3. Conduct performance benchmarking on target devices
4. Final accessibility review
5. User testing with mobile-first workflow

## Performance Metrics

Implementation successfully delivers:
- Responsive layout switching based on device size
- Touch-optimized UI components with minimum 48px targets
- Virtual scrolling for efficient rendering of large datasets
- Offline storage capabilities with sync queue
- Memory management features for mobile constraints
