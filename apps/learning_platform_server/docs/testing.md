# Learning Platform Server Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Learning Platform Server, including types of tests, tools used, and best practices.

## Testing Principles

1. **Test Pyramid**: Follow the testing pyramid approach with unit tests at the base, integration tests in the middle, and end-to-end tests at the top
2. **Automated Testing**: All tests should be automated and run as part of the CI/CD pipeline
3. **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical business logic
4. **Isolation**: Tests should be independent and not rely on shared state
5. **Speed**: Tests should run quickly to enable rapid feedback
6. **Reliability**: Tests should be deterministic and not flaky

## Types of Tests

### 1. Unit Tests

**Purpose**: Test individual functions, methods, and modules in isolation

**Characteristics**:
- Fast execution
- No external dependencies (database, network, etc.)
- High coverage of edge cases
- Use mocks and stubs when needed

**Location**: `src/` directory alongside the code being tested

**Example**:
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn test_addition() {
        assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
    }
}
```

### 2. Integration Tests

**Purpose**: Test the interaction between multiple components and subsystems

**Characteristics**:
- Test real database interactions
- Test service integration
- Test API endpoints
- May require test database setup

**Location**: `tests/` directory

**Example**:
```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_user_registration() {
    // Test user registration flow with database
}
```

### 3. Benchmark Tests

**Purpose**: Measure performance of critical functions and identify bottlenecks

**Characteristics**:
- Use Criterion.rs for accurate benchmarking
- Run regularly to detect performance regressions
- Focus on critical paths and hot functions

**Location**: `benches/` directory

**Example**:
```rust
fn criterion_benchmark(c: &mut Criterion) {
    c.bench_function("fibonacci", |b| {
        b.iter(|| fibonacci(10))
    });
}
```

### 4. Example Tests

**Purpose**: Demonstrate usage of the API and serve as documentation

**Characteristics**:
- Executable examples
- Show real-world usage patterns
- Can be run as tests

**Location**: `examples/` directory

## Testing Tools

### 1. Rust Testing Framework

Built-in testing framework with `#[test]` attribute

### 2. Tokio

For async testing with `#[tokio::test]` attribute

### 3. Criterion.rs

For benchmarking with `#[cfg(test)]` and `criterion` dependency

### 4. SQLx

For database testing with test database connections

## Test Organization

### Unit Tests

Located alongside the code they test:
```
src/
├── utils.rs
├── utils_test.rs
├── database/
│   ├── repository.rs
│   └── repository_test.rs
```

### Integration Tests

Located in the `tests/` directory:
```
tests/
├── database_test.rs
├── service_test.rs
├── integration_test.rs
└── utils_test.rs
```

### Benchmark Tests

Located in the `benches/` directory:
```
benches/
├── service_benchmark.rs
└── utils_benchmark.rs
```

## Test Data Management

### Test Database

- Use a separate test database instance
- Run migrations before tests
- Clean up data after tests
- Use transactions for test isolation when possible

### Test Data Generation

- Use factories or builders for complex test data
- Use realistic test data
- Avoid hardcoded test data when possible
- Use UUIDs for unique identifiers

## Continuous Integration

### Test Execution

- Run all tests on every commit
- Run benchmarks periodically (not on every commit)
- Fail fast on test failures
- Report test coverage

### Test Environments

- Use consistent test environments
- Isolate test runs
- Use containerization for consistency

## Best Practices

### 1. Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive test names
- Follow naming pattern: `test_action_scenario_expected_result`
- Example: `test_user_registration_with_valid_data_success`

### 2. Test Structure

- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- One assertion per test when possible
- Clear setup and teardown

### 3. Mocking

- Use mocks for external dependencies
- Avoid over-mocking
- Test real implementations when possible

### 4. Test Data

- Use realistic test data
- Avoid shared test data
- Clean up test data after tests

### 5. Performance

- Keep tests fast
- Use parallel test execution
- Avoid unnecessary setup in tests

## Test Coverage

### Goals

- Unit tests: 90%+ coverage
- Integration tests: 80%+ coverage
- Critical paths: 100% coverage

### Tools

- Use `cargo tarpaulin` or similar for coverage reporting
- Set coverage thresholds in CI
- Monitor coverage trends

## Debugging Tests

### Logging

- Use logging in tests for debugging
- Set appropriate log levels for tests
- Use structured logging

### Debugging Tools

- Use `dbg!` macro for quick debugging
- Use IDE debugging features
- Use `println!` for test output

## Test Maintenance

### Refactoring

- Update tests when refactoring code
- Keep tests DRY
- Use test helpers and utilities

### Flaky Tests

- Identify and fix flaky tests
- Use retries for inherently flaky tests
- Monitor test stability

## Security Testing

### Input Validation

- Test with invalid inputs
- Test boundary conditions
- Test injection attacks

### Authentication

- Test authentication flows
- Test authorization checks
- Test session management

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing

- Use tools like `wrk` or `k6` for load testing
- Test under expected load conditions
- Monitor resource usage

### Stress Testing

- Test under extreme conditions
- Identify breaking points
- Test recovery mechanisms

## Documentation

### Test Documentation

- Document complex test setups
- Document test assumptions
- Keep documentation up to date

### Example Code

- Use examples as documentation
- Keep examples working
- Test examples as part of the test suite

## Future Improvements

### Test Automation

- Automate test environment setup
- Automate test data generation
- Automate test result analysis

### Advanced Testing

- Property-based testing with `proptest`
- Fuzz testing for security
- Chaos engineering for resilience

### Monitoring

- Monitor test execution times
- Monitor test stability
- Monitor coverage trends
