## Next Steps for Community Launch

1. Review the launch preparation checklist in `docs/launch_preparation_checklist.md`
2. Train community facilitators using the provided resources in `docs/facilitator/`
3. Customize materials for your specific community context using `docs/templates/community_customization.md`
4. Execute the phased rollout plan:
   - Beta testing with core members
   - Early adopter phase
   - Majority community rollout
   - Full community launch
5. Monitor launch metrics and community feedback using the integrated systems
6. Celebrate community achievements and milestones using the celebration framework
7. Continuously improve based on community feedback and validation

## System Architecture Overview

The launch preparation system follows the dashboard's hexagonal architecture principles:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Launch Coordinator                       │
│  (Central integration point for all launch activities)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                   │         │         │         │
┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐
│Readiness│  │Notification│ │Rollout│  │ Metrics │  │Facilitator│
└─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘
                   │         │         │         │
┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐
│Celebration││ Feedback │  │  Tests  │  │   Docs  │  │Templates│
└─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘
```

All components are designed with cooperative principles at their core, emphasizing:
- Community benefit over individual achievement
- Reciprocity in impact relationships
- Transparency in processes and outcomes
- Inclusivity in design and access
