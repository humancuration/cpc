# Data Models Documentation

This document describes the data models used in the Unified Community Impact Dashboard.

## Overview

The dashboard uses a comprehensive set of data models to represent impact data from all four measurement systems and their interconnections. These models are designed to:

1. Provide a holistic view of individual and community impact
2. Capture the interconnected nature of learning, volunteering, financial participation, and cause engagement
3. Support both individual and community-level analysis
4. Enable values-aligned interpretation of impact metrics
