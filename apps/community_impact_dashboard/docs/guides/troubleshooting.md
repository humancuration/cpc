# Troubleshooting Common Issues

## Introduction

This guide provides solutions for common technical and conceptual challenges that may arise when facilitating sessions with the Unified Community Impact Dashboard. Use this resource to prepare for potential issues and respond effectively when they occur.

## Technical Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Loading Issues

**Problem**: Dashboard takes too long to load or fails to load completely.

**Solutions**:
- Check internet connection stability
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try refreshing the page multiple times
- Test dashboard access on different browsers
- Use the mobile app version if available
- Have printed dashboards as backup materials

### Visualization Display Problems

**Problem**: Charts or graphs are not displaying correctly.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure browser is up to date
- Disable browser extensions that might interfere
- Try different visualization styles
- Check if data is still loading (look for loading indicators)
- Report persistent issues to technical support

### Data Loading Errors

**Problem**: Data appears outdated or missing.

**Solutions**:
- Check data source status and connectivity
- Verify user permissions for data access
- Try refreshing the data manually
- Confirm that data collection processes are running
- Contact data administrators if issues persist

### Browser Compatibility Issues

**Problem**: Dashboard features work differently across browsers.

**Solutions**:
- Recommend using Chrome, Firefox, or Safari
- Test all planned activities on participants' browsers beforehand
- Have alternative activities prepared for unsupported features
- Provide guidance on browser settings that may affect performance

### Mobile Device Challenges

**Problem**: Dashboard is difficult to use on mobile devices.

**Solutions**:
- Recommend using tablets instead of phones when possible
- Use the mobile-optimized version of the dashboard
- Prepare simplified activities for smaller screens
- Have laptops available for complex tasks

## Conceptual Troubleshooting

### Overwhelm with Complexity

**Problem**: Participants feel overwhelmed by interconnected impact concepts.

**Solutions**:
- Break down concepts into smaller, digestible pieces
- Use familiar community examples and analogies
- Provide take-home reference materials
- Offer follow-up sessions for deeper exploration
- Normalize the learning curve and encourage questions

### Skepticism About Data

**Problem**: Participants question the accuracy or relevance of dashboard data.

**Solutions**:
- Be transparent about data sources and collection methods
- Acknowledge limitations and uncertainties in the data
- Connect data to participants' lived experiences
- Encourage participants to contribute their own data and stories
- Explain how data is validated through community processes

### Resistance to New Processes

**Problem**: Participants are hesitant to engage with collaborative validation.

**Solutions**:
- Explain the benefits and purpose of community validation
- Start with low-stakes activities to build comfort
- Share success stories from other communities
- Respect participants' comfort levels while gently encouraging participation
- Connect validation activities to participants' existing interests and values

### Difficulty Interpreting Visualizations

**Problem**: Participants struggle to understand dashboard visualizations.

**Solutions**:
- Provide clear explanations of visualization elements
- Use the visualization explanation feature in the dashboard
- Offer multiple visualization styles for the same data
- Encourage participants to ask questions about what they see
- Connect visualizations to numerical data when helpful

## Group Process Troubleshooting

### Dominant Voices

**Problem**: A few participants dominate discussions.

**Solutions**:
- Use structured techniques like round-robin sharing
- Create small group activities before large group discussion
- Direct questions specifically to quieter participants
- Establish ground rules about equitable participation
- Use written reflection activities to gather input from all

### Quiet Groups

**Problem**: Participants are reluctant to share or engage.

**Solutions**:
- Start with individual reflection time before group discussion
- Use anonymous input methods (sticky notes, online polls)
- Share your own observations to model participation
- Create a safe environment for vulnerability and curiosity
- Offer multiple ways to contribute (verbal, written, artistic)

### Conflict and Disagreement

**Problem**: Participants have strong disagreements about data interpretation.

**Solutions**:
- Reframe disagreement as healthy exploration of complexity
- Focus on evidence and reasoning rather than personal opinions
- Encourage participants to consider multiple perspectives
- Use data to ground discussions while acknowledging interpretation
- Separate facts from values and opinions when helpful

### Off-Topic Discussions

**Problem**: Group conversations stray from the planned agenda.

**Solutions**:
- Acknowledge the relevance of topics while gently redirecting
- Use a parking lot to capture off-topic ideas for later discussion
- Connect off-topic conversations back to session objectives when possible
- Respect the group's energy while maintaining focus on goals
- Schedule breaks to allow for informal conversation

## Accessibility Troubleshooting

### Visual Impairments

**Problem**: Participants with visual impairments struggle with dashboard elements.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure high contrast mode is available and functioning
- Provide verbal descriptions of visualizations
- Offer larger text options
- Use screen reader-compatible features
- Provide printed materials in accessible formats

### Hearing Impairments

**Problem**: Participants with hearing impairments miss verbal instructions.

**Solutions**:
- Provide written instructions for all activities
- Use visual cues and gestures to support communication
- Ensure all participants can see visual presentations clearly
- Provide sign language interpretation when needed
- Use chat or written feedback tools for questions

### Mobility Challenges

**Problem**: Participants with mobility challenges have difficulty accessing materials.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure accessible seating and workspace arrangements
- Provide digital materials that can be accessed from seats
- Use online collaboration tools for group activities
- Offer breaks as needed
- Position materials within easy reach

## Cultural Sensitivity Troubleshooting

### Language Barriers

**Problem**: Participants struggle with technical terminology or session language.

**Solutions**:
- Provide materials in multiple languages when possible
- Use simple, clear language and avoid jargon
- Use visual aids to support verbal explanations
- Pair participants who speak different languages
- Have bilingual facilitators or interpreters available

### Cultural Misalignment

**Problem**: Session content or approach doesn't resonate with participants' cultural context.

**Solutions**:
- Customize examples and references to local context
- Adapt facilitation style to cultural communication norms
- Include community leaders in session planning
- Acknowledge and honor different ways of knowing and being
- Be flexible in approach based on group response

## Emergency and Crisis Situations

### Technical System Failure

**Problem**: Complete dashboard or internet failure during a session.

**Solutions**:
- Have printed materials and backup activities ready
- Use flip charts and markers for collaborative work
- Continue discussions using traditional facilitation methods
- Reschedule technical activities for another time
- Document session outcomes manually for later entry

### Participant Distress

**Problem**: A participant becomes emotionally overwhelmed during data review.

**Solutions**:
- Pause the session and check in with the individual
- Provide space and support as needed
- Offer to continue participation in a modified way
- Connect the participant with appropriate support resources
- Debrief with the group about emotional responses to data

### External Disruptions

**Problem**: Session is interrupted by external events (fire alarm, power outage, etc.).
