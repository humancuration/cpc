# Deployment Guide

This document provides instructions for deploying and using the Unified Community Impact Dashboard.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the dashboard, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Rust toolchain** (latest stable version)
- **wasm-pack** (for WebAssembly compilation)
- **Trunk** (for serving the web application)
- **Basic understanding of Yew framework**

## Building for Web

### Development Build

To build the dashboard for development:

```bash
# Navigate to the app directory
cd apps/community_impact_dashboard

# Build for WebAssembly
wasm-pack build --target web --dev

# Serve the application
trunk serve
```

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Production Build

To build the dashboard for production:

```bash
# Navigate to the app directory
cd apps/community_impact_dashboard

# Build for WebAssembly with optimizations
wasm-pack build --target web --release

# Build the static site
trunk build --release
```

The production build will be available in the `dist/` directory.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The dashboard can be configured using environment variables:

- `API_URL`: Base URL for the API server
- `CONSENT_LEVEL`: Default consent level for data collection
- `THEME`: UI theme (light/dark)
- `DEFAULT_VISUALIZATION_STYLE`: Default visualization style

### Trunk Configuration

The `Trunk.toml` file contains configuration for the Trunk build tool:

```toml
[build]
dist = "dist"
public_url = "/"
filehash = true
minify = "on"
csp = "on"
assets = ["assets"]

[watch]
watch = true
ignore = ["dist", "target"]

[serve]
address = "127.0.0.1"
port = 8080
open = false

[tools]
[wasm-bindgen]
optimize = true
deduplicate = true

[wasm-opt]
optimization_level = "z"
shrink_level = 2
debug_info = false

[final]
brotli = true
gzip = true

[profile.release]
lto = true
codegen-units = 1
panic = "abort"
```


The `Trunk.toml` file contains configuration for the Trunk build tool:

```toml
[build]
target = "index.html"
dist = "dist"
watch = true
port = 8080

[serve]
address = "127.0.0.1"
port = 8080
reload = true
```

## Deployment Options

### Static Hosting

The dashboard can be deployed to any static hosting service:

1. Build the production version
2. Upload the contents of the `dist/` directory
3. Configure the hosting service to serve `index.html` for all routes

### Docker Deployment

A Dockerfile can be created for containerized deployment:

```dockerfile
FROM rust:latest as builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN cargo install trunk
RUN rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
RUN trunk build --release

FROM caddy:2-alpine

COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/caddy
EXPOSE 80

CMD ["caddy", "file-server", "--root", "/usr/share/caddy", "--listen", ":80"]
```

### Server Deployment

For server deployment with a reverse proxy:

1. Build the production version
2. Deploy the `dist/` directory to your web server
3. Configure your reverse proxy (nginx, Apache, etc.) to serve the files

## Community Validation Features

### Data Storage

The community validation features require additional data storage considerations:

1. **Documentation Storage**: Community interpretations, reflections, and documentation are stored in the database
2. **Session Data**: Collaborative interpretation sessions require temporary storage
3. **User Contributions**: Community insights and action items need to be associated with user accounts

### Performance Considerations

For optimal performance of community validation features:

- Implement efficient indexing for documentation search and retrieval
- Use caching for frequently accessed documentation
- Optimize real-time collaboration features
- Implement pagination for large documentation sets

## Integration with Backend Services

### API Integration

The dashboard integrates with several backend services:

1. **Learning Impact Tracker API**: For learning engagement data
2. **Volunteer Impact Tracker API**: For volunteer participation data
3. **Financial Impact Tracker API**: For financial participation data
4. **Cause Impact Tracker API**: For cause engagement data
5. **Community Graph API**: For community network data
6. **Social Interactions API**: For community engagement patterns

### Database Configuration

The dashboard requires access to databases used by the impact tracking systems:

- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for financial impact data
- **Sled**: Embedded database for local caching
- **Redis**: For session management and caching

### Authentication

The dashboard supports authentication through:

- **OAuth2**: Integration with external identity providers
- **JWT**: Token-based authentication
- **Session management**: Server-side session storage

## Performance Optimization

### Build Optimizations

To optimize the build process:

```bash
# Enable link-time optimization
wasm-pack build --target web --release --features "lto"

# Optimize for size
wasm-pack build --target web --release -- --config-profile release-lto
```

### Runtime Optimizations

For runtime performance:

- Enable browser caching for static assets
- Use a CDN for serving static files
- Implement service workers for offline support
- Optimize images and other media assets

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Error Tracking

The dashboard includes error tracking capabilities:

- Console logging for development
- Integration with error tracking services
- Performance monitoring
- User experience analytics

### Usage Analytics

To track dashboard usage:

- Page view tracking
- Feature usage metrics
- Performance metrics
- User engagement analytics

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- All user data is encrypted in transit
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- Privacy-preserving techniques are used for data collection
- Consent management is implemented for all data collection

### Authentication Security

- Secure password hashing using Argon2
- JWT token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- OAuth2 state parameter validation
- CSRF protection for forms

### Input Validation

- Client-side validation for user inputs
- Server-side validation for all data
- Sanitization of user-generated content
- Protection against XSS and injection attacks

## Maintenance

### Updates

To update the dashboard:

1. Pull the latest code from the repository
2. Run `cargo update` to update dependencies
3. Rebuild the application
4. Deploy the updated version

### Backups

For backup procedures:

- Regular database backups
- Configuration file backups
- Static asset backups
- User data export capabilities

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Build failures**: Check Rust toolchain version and dependencies
- **Runtime errors**: Check browser console for error messages
- **Performance issues**: Check network requests and asset sizes
- **Data loading problems**: Verify API connectivity and permissions

## Scaling

### Horizontal Scaling

For handling increased load:

- Deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer
- Use a CDN for static assets
- Implement database connection pooling
- Use caching layers for frequently accessed data

### Vertical Scaling

For improving performance on a single instance:

- Increase server resources (CPU, memory)
- Optimize database queries
- Implement more aggressive caching
- Use more efficient algorithms

## Customization

### Theming

The dashboard supports theming through:

- CSS custom properties
- Theme switching components
- Dark/light mode support
- Custom theme creation

### Localization

For supporting multiple languages:

- Internationalization framework
- Translation file management
