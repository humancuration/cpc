### Introduction
We're excited to announce the launch of a powerful new tool that will help us all better understand how our individual actions connect to create collective transformation in our community.

### What is the Community Impact Dashboard?
The Unified Community Impact Dashboard is an innovative platform that shows how our engagement across four key areas - learning, volunteering, financial participation, and cause advocacy - all interconnect to amplify our collective impact.

Rather than viewing these areas separately, the dashboard reveals the web of connections between them, helping us see how our involvement in one area strengthens our effectiveness in others.

ü§ù **Community Validation Tools** - Collaboratively interpret our impact data together

üìñ **Impact Story Collection** - Share and discover stories that demonstrate interconnected impact

### Why This Matters
