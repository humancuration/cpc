# Community Validation Documentation

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the community validation tools in the Unified Community Impact Dashboard. These tools facilitate collaborative interpretation of impact data and community reflection sessions, enabling communities to make sense of their collective impact together.

## Overview

Community validation is a cornerstone of the cooperative approach to impact measurement. Rather than having impact data interpreted by external experts or algorithms, the dashboard provides tools for communities to engage in collaborative sense-making processes.

The community validation system includes three primary components:

1. **Collaborative Interpreter**: A structured process for making sense of impact data together
2. **Community Reflection**: Facilitated reflection sessions for deeper understanding
3. **Documentation Center**: A central repository for community insights and outcomes
