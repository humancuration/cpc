## System Architecture Overview

The launch preparation system follows the dashboard's hexagonal architecture principles:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Launch Coordinator                       │
│  (Central integration point for all launch activities)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                   │         │         │         │
┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐
│Readiness│  │Notification│ │Rollout│  │ Metrics │  │Facilitator│
└─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘
                   │         │         │         │
┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐
│Celebration││ Feedback │  │  Tests  │  │   Docs  │  │Templates│
└─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘  └─────────┘
```

## Next Steps for Community Launch

1. ✅ Review the launch preparation checklist in `docs/launch_preparation_checklist.md`
2. ✅ Train community facilitators using the provided resources in `docs/facilitator/`
3. ✅ Customize materials for your specific community context using `docs/templates/community_customization.md`
4. ✅ Execute the phased rollout plan:
   - Beta testing with core members
   - Early adopter phase
   - Majority community rollout
   - Full community launch
5. ✅ Monitor launch metrics and community feedback using the integrated systems
6. ✅ Celebrate community achievements and milestones using the celebration framework
7. ✅ Continuously improve based on community feedback and validation
