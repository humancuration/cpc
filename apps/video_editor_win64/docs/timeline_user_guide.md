# Timeline User Guide

## Overview

The timeline is the central component of the video editor where you arrange and edit your media clips. It supports multiple video and audio tracks, keyframe animation, and real-time preview.

## Basic Concepts

### Tracks
- **Video Tracks**: Contain video clips, images, and titles
- **Audio Tracks**: Contain audio clips with volume and pan controls
- **Layers**: Tracks are ordered by layer (Z-index), with 0 being the bottom layer

### Clips
- **Position**: Defined by start time and duration
- **Properties**: Can be animated using keyframes
- **Effects**: Applied to individual clips or entire tracks

## Working with the Timeline

### Adding Tracks
1. Click the "+" button in the track header area
2. Select "Video Track" or "Audio Track"
3. The new track will appear at the top of its respective section

### Adding Clips
1. Drag media from the media bin onto a track
2. Position the clip by dragging its edges
3. Trim the clip by dragging its left or right edge

### Keyframe Animation
1. Right-click on a clip and select "Add Keyframe"
2. Choose the property to animate (position, scale, opacity, etc.)
3. Set the initial value and time
4. Move the playhead to a different time and add another keyframe
5. The property will interpolate between keyframes

### Effects
1. Select a clip or track
2. Open the Effects panel
3. Drag an effect onto the clip or track
4. Adjust effect parameters in the Properties panel

## Performance Tips

### For Smooth Playback
- Use the frame cache for real-time scrubbing
- Enable LOD (Level of Detail) sampling for complex timelines
- Keep clip overlaps to a minimum to reduce compositing overhead

### For Efficient Editing
- Use spatial indexing to quickly locate clips
- Group related clips into nested compositions
- Use keyboard shortcuts for common operations

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Play/Pause | Space |
| Move to Previous Frame | Left Arrow |
| Move to Next Frame | Right Arrow |
| Add Marker | M |
| Split Clip | Ctrl+K |
| Ripple Delete | Shift+Delete |

## Troubleshooting

### Playback Issues
- If playback is choppy, try reducing the preview resolution
- Check that your frame cache size is adequate for your project
- Close other applications to free up system resources

### Clip Problems
- If clips aren't appearing, check that they're not muted or locked
- Verify that clip durations are correct
- Check for conflicting keyframes that might cause unexpected behavior

## Advanced Features

### Nested Compositions
Create a composition within another composition to:
- Reuse complex arrangements
- Apply effects to multiple clips at once
- Organize complex projects

### Spatial Indexing
The timeline uses R-tree spatial indexing for:
- Fast clip lookup by time
- Efficient rendering of large timelines
- Quick selection of overlapping clips

### LOD Sampling
Level of Detail sampling reduces workload by:
- Lowering preview resolution during scrubbing
- Skipping evaluation of nested compositions
- Reducing keyframe sampling rate

These features help maintain interactive performance even with complex projects.
