# Unified Authentication System Integration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the unified authentication system for the Allat application, which provides centralized identity management across all CPC applications.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Extended User Model
- Added consent fields to the User struct in `apps/allat/src/domain/auth/user.rs`
- User model now includes karma score and consent preferences

### 2. RBAC System
- Created new `cpc_rbac` package with role-based access control engine
- Implemented role and permission management
- Updated authorization middleware to use RBAC system

### 3. Karma System
- Created new `cpc_karma` package for user reputation management
- Implemented karma tracking, addition, removal, and transfer functionality

### 4. Consent Management
- Created new `cpc_consent` package for data sharing preferences
- Implemented consent levels and domain-specific consent profiles
- Created consent middleware for enforcing consent requirements

### 5. Redis Session Store
- Extended `cpc_auth` package with Redis-based session store
- Implemented session creation, retrieval, and deletion with TTL

### 6. gRPC Auth Service
- Created new `auth_service` application with gRPC interface
- Implemented session validation, creation, and invalidation methods
- Defined protobuf service definition for authentication operations

## Key Files Modified

1. `apps/allat/src/domain/auth/user.rs` - Extended User model
2. `apps/allat/src/infrastructure/middleware/authorization.rs` - Updated to use RBAC
3. `packages/cpc_auth/src/error.rs` - Added new error types
4. `packages/cpc_auth/src/session.rs` - Implemented Redis session store
5. `packages/cpc_auth/Cargo.toml` - Added Redis dependency

## New Packages Created

1. `packages/cpc_rbac` - Role-based access control system
2. `packages/cpc_karma` - User reputation system
3. `packages/cpc_consent` - Consent management system
4. `apps/auth_service` - gRPC authentication service

## Documentation Updates

1. `docs/auth_service_api.md` - Detailed API documentation for auth service
2. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Added section on unified authentication system

## Integration Points

### Allat Application
- Uses RBAC for permission checking
- Integrates with karma system for user reputation
- Implements consent management for data sharing
- Uses Redis session store for session management

### Cross-Application Compatibility
- Unified identity system works across Yapper, Presence, and SocialGraph apps
- Shared RBAC roles and permissions
- Consistent karma tracking across applications
- Domain-specific consent management

## Testing
- Unit tests for RBAC engine
- Unit tests for karma service
- Unit tests for consent management
- Integration tests for cross-app auth flow (to be implemented)

## Dependencies Added
- redis = "0.23.0"
- tonic = "0.9.0"
- prost = "0.12.0"
- serde_json = "1.0"
