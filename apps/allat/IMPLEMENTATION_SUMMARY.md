# Allat Authentication Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the authentication system for the Allat application, which extends the base CPC authentication system with karma tracking and community roles.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Dependency Management
- Added `cpc_auth` dependency to Cargo.toml
- Added `sled` and `bincode` for local storage
- Added `tempfile` for testing

### 2. Domain Models
Created domain auth modules:
- `credentials.rs`: Re-exports Credentials from cpc_auth
- `user.rs`: Extended User model with karma tracking
- `session.rs`: Re-exports Session from cpc_auth
- `auth_error.rs`: Re-exports AuthError from cpc_auth
- `community_role.rs`: Community role definitions (Moderator, Admin, Contributor)

### 3. AuthService Implementation
Created `auth_service.rs` with:
- `AllatAuthService` struct that wraps the base auth service
- Extended trait with karma tracking methods:
  - `increment_karma(user_id, amount)`
  - `get_karma(user_id)`
- Extended trait with community role methods:
  - `assign_community_role(user_id, role)`
  - `get_community_roles(user_id)`

### 4. Infrastructure Repositories
Created `user_repository.rs` with:
- `SledUserRepository` implementation for local storage
- `StoredUser` struct for serialization
- Methods for saving users, finding by ID, updating karma, and managing community roles

### 5. Application Integration
Created `vote_service.rs` demonstrating integration with the vote system:
- Example of how upvotes/downvotes could update user karma
- Notes on implementation details for a full system

### 6. Main Application Setup
Updated `main.rs` to:
- Initialize base auth service
- Initialize user repository with Sled
- Initialize Allat auth service
- Include example usage of the auth service

### 7. Testing
Created `auth_service_test.rs` with:
- Tests for user registration
- Tests for karma tracking functionality

### 8. Documentation
Created documentation files:
- `AUTH_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md`: Overview of the implementation
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`: This file

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Extensibility**: The implementation extends rather than replaces the base CPC auth system
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Domain models, application services, and infrastructure are separated
3. **Local Storage**: Uses Sled for local storage of Allat-specific user data
4. **Compatibility**: Maintains full compatibility with existing CPC auth system
5. **Future-Ready**: Designed to support additional community roles and features

## Integration Points

1. **Base Auth System**: Leverages existing CPC authentication
2. **Vote System**: Demonstrates how karma tracking integrates with voting
3. **Session Management**: Compatible with existing session handling
4. **Error Handling**: Extends base error types with Allat-specific cases

## Next Steps

1. Implement role-based access control
2. Enhance karma algorithms with more sophisticated logic
3. Add integration with other Allat domain services
4. Implement full vote system integration with post author lookup
5. Add more comprehensive tests
