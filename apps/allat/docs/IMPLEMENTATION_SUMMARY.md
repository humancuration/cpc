# Allat Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the implementation work completed for the Allat application's database layer.

## Completed Implementation Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Implementation

- Created complete database schema based on domain models
- Implemented all required tables: communities, users, posts, media_assets, votes
- Added appropriate indexes for query performance
- Documented schema in `docs/database_schema.md`

### 2. Migration System

- Created migration directory structure: `migrations/`
- Implemented up migration: `0001_initial_schema.up.sql`
- Implemented down migration: `0001_initial_schema.down.sql`
- Added migration README with usage instructions
- Verified migrations work correctly with test suite

### 3. Database Connection and Setup

- Updated `Cargo.toml` with required SQLx dependencies
- Added database setup function in `src/main.rs`
- Implemented automatic migration application on startup
- Added proper error handling for database connections

### 4. Repository Implementation Updates

- Updated comment repository to use posts table with parent_id (aligning with schema)
- Verified all repository implementations match the database schema
- Ensured proper foreign key relationships are maintained

### 5. Testing

- Created database migration test suite
- Verified migrations can be applied and rolled back
- Confirmed all tables and indexes are created correctly

### 6. Documentation

- Created database setup guide: `docs/database_setup.md`
- Created database implementation summary: `docs/database_implementation_summary.md`
- Created testing guide: `docs/testing.md`
- Updated migration README with usage instructions

## Key Design Decisions

### Comments Storage

Comments are stored in the same `posts` table as regular posts, with the `parent_id` field indicating the relationship:
- `NULL` for top-level posts
- Reference to parent post ID for comments
- Reference to parent comment ID for nested replies

### Vote System

Votes are stored in a separate `votes` table with:
- Unique constraint on (user_id, post_id) to prevent duplicate voting
- Vote type field to distinguish between upvotes and downvotes

### Media Assets

Media assets are stored in a separate `media_assets` table with:
- Foreign key reference to the post they belong to
- Support for both images and videos
- Optional thumbnail URLs and alt text

## Environment Configuration

- Database connection configured via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Test database connection via `TEST_DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Default development database: `postgresql://localhost/allat_dev`

## Verification

All implementation has been verified through:
- Manual code review
- Automated test suite
- Migration testing
- Repository functionality testing

## Next Steps

- Implement additional repository methods as needed
- Add more comprehensive integration tests
- Monitor database performance and optimize queries as needed
- Add monitoring and logging for database operations
