# Messenger Web Frontend Summary

This document summarizes the web frontend implementation for the CPC Messenger application.

## Overview

The web frontend is built with Yew, a Rust framework for creating multi-threaded front-end web apps with WebAssembly. It reuses UI components from the messenger_win64 crate and provides a complete messaging interface.

## Features Implemented

1. **Real-time Messaging Interface**
   - Conversation view with message history
   - Message input with send functionality
   - Online status indicators

2. **Message Interactions**
   - Reaction support (like, heart, laugh, etc.)
   - Thread creation from messages
   - Thread viewing

3. **Group Management**
   - Group settings modal
   - Participant management interface

4. **Media Sharing**
   - File upload with drag-and-drop support
   - Media preview for images, documents, audio, and video

## Architecture

The web frontend follows a component-based architecture:

```
src/
├── components/     # Re-exports of UI components from messenger_win64
├── pages/          # Page components for routing
├── services/       # Service layers for API communication
├── lib.rs          # Main application component and routing
└── main.rs         # Entry point for the WASM application
```

## Technologies Used

- **Yew**: Rust framework for building web applications
- **Yew Router**: Routing solution for Yew applications
- **Stylist**: CSS-in-Rust styling solution
- **Web APIs**: For file handling, network requests, and DOM manipulation
- **GraphQL**: For API communication with the backend
- **WebSockets**: Planned for real-time messaging (not yet implemented)

## Pages

### Home Page
- Welcome screen with app features
- Call-to-action for getting started

### Conversation Page
- Main messaging interface
- Message history display
- Message input area
- Media upload support

### Thread Page
- Dedicated view for threaded conversations
- Back navigation to parent conversation

### Not Found Page
- Error page for invalid routes

## Services

### GraphQL Service
- Handles GraphQL queries and mutations
- Communicates with the backend API

### Auth Service
- Manages user authentication state
- Handles login/logout functionality

### Messaging Service
- Manages real-time messaging
- Handles message sending and receiving

## Styling

The application uses Stylist for CSS-in-Rust styling, which provides:
- Component-scoped styles
- Type-safe CSS
- Dynamic styling based on component state

## Build Process

The application is built using Trunk, which:
- Compiles Rust to WebAssembly
- Optimizes the output for production
- Handles static asset processing
- Provides a development server with hot reloading

## Future Improvements

- Implement real-time updates using WebSockets
- Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Improve accessibility features
- Add internationalization support
- Implement offline functionality
- Add push notifications
- Improve mobile responsiveness
- Add theming support
