## Summary of Changes

I've implemented the visualization rendering in the `EmbeddedVisualization` component according to the requirements. Here are the key changes made:

### 1. Updated `EmbeddedVisualization` Component (`apps/feedback_showcase/src/components/social_sharing/embedded_visualization.rs`)

- Added new props for data and loading state:
  - `data: Option<Vec<Review<Product>>>`
  - `loading: bool`
- Added proper imports for visualization components
- Implemented actual rendering logic that:
  - Shows a loading message when data is being fetched
  - Renders the appropriate visualization component based on the visualization type
  - Falls back to the placeholder when no data is available
- Made all props optional with default values where appropriate

### 2. Enhanced Federation Service (`apps/feedback_showcase/src/services/federation.rs`)

- Updated `get_shared_visualization` to return mock data with actual reviews instead of an empty vector
- Added three sample reviews with different sentiments for demonstration
- Set default visualization type to "WordCloud" for better demo experience

### 3. Updated Embed Page Component (`apps/feedback_showcase/src/components/embed_page.rs`)

- Added state management for shared visualization data
- Implemented proper data fetching using `use_effect_with` and `wasm_bindgen_futures::spawn_local`
- Extracted visualization type and data from the shared visualization
- Passed the data and loading state to the `EmbeddedVisualization` component

### 4. Added CSS Styles (`apps/feedback_showcase/static/styles.css`)

- Added styles for the loading state within the embedded visualization
- Kept existing styles for the embed page loading and error states

### 5. Fixed File Structure (`apps/feedback_showcase/src/components/embed_page.rs`)

- Fixed a structural issue in the file where the function component was not properly closed

These changes enable the `EmbeddedVisualization` component to fetch and render actual visualizations based on shared data, with proper loading states and error handling.
