# Feedback Showcase - Data Generator Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the data generator module for the feedback showcase application. The module provides functionality to generate realistic sample data for product reviews, survey responses, and federated reviews.

## Files Created

### Core Module Structure
- `src/data_generator/mod.rs` - Main module file
- `src/data_generator/lib.rs` - Library exports
- `src/data_generator/README.md` - Documentation

### Configuration
- `src/data_generator/config.rs` - Configuration structures

### Generators
- `src/data_generator/generators/mod.rs` - Generator module
- `src/data_generator/generators/products.rs` - Product generation
- `src/data_generator/generators/reviews.rs` - Review generation
- `src/data_generator/generators/surveys.rs` - Survey response generation
- `src/data_generator/generators/federation.rs` - Federated review generation

### Utilities
- `src/data_generator/utils.rs` - Utility functions
- `src/data_generator/tests.rs` - Unit tests

### Examples
- `examples/data_generator_usage.rs` - Usage example

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Configuration System
- Flexible configuration structures for all data types
- Weighted distributions for demographics
- Rating distribution parameters
- Product type configurations

### 2. Product Generation
- Realistic product name generation
- Product description generation
- Support for different product categories

### 3. Review Generation
- Realistic review title and content generation using fake data
- Rating generation with normal distribution
- Attribute generation (pros/cons)
- Demographic information based on weighted distributions
- Parallel processing for large datasets

### 4. Survey Response Generation
- Answer generation for all question types
- Correlation between review ratings and survey answers
- Random selection of reviews for survey responses
- Parallel processing for large datasets

### 5. Federation Generation
- Random federation metadata
- Consent rules with different sharing groups
- Partner and public sharing options
- Parallel processing for large datasets

### 6. Performance Features
- Parallel processing using Rayon for datasets > 10,000 records
- Streaming generation for very large datasets
- Efficient memory usage with pre-allocation

## Dependencies Added

- `rand = "0.8"` - Random number generation
- `fake = "2.4"` - Fake data generation
- `rayon = "1.5"` - Parallel processing

## Integration with Main Application

The data generator has been fully integrated into the main showcase application:

1. Replaced manual sample creation with automated generation
2. Added configuration setup
3. Maintained all validation requirements
4. Preserved data relationships between reviews and survey responses

## Validation

- All generated reviews pass `review.validate()`
- Statistical distribution accuracy maintained
- Data relationships preserved (review â†” survey response)

## Testing

- Unit tests for core functionality
- Example usage demonstration
- Integration with existing showcase application

## Usage

```bash
# Run the main showcase
cargo run

# Run the data generator example
cargo run --example data_generator_usage
```

## Performance

The generator efficiently handles large datasets through:
- Parallel processing with Rayon
- Streaming generation for >10,000 records
- Memory-efficient data structures

## Web UI Features

### New UI Modules
- `src/components/` - Yew-based UI components
- `src/services/` - Service layer for UI-core integration

### UI Components
- DataGeneratorUI - Main application component
- ConfigPanel - Configuration interface with forms
- ActionBar - Action buttons (Generate, Export, Reset)
- MetricsPanel - Real-time metrics display

### Web Dependencies Added
- `yew = "0.21"` - Web framework for UI components
- `yew-components = "0.5"` - Prebuilt UI components
- `gloo-timers = "0.3"` - Timer utilities for metrics
- `wasm-bindgen-futures = "0.4"` - Futures integration for WASM

### Web Usage
```bash
# Build for web
wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir static/pkg

# Serve the static files
python -m http.server 8000

# Open http://localhost:8000/static/index.html
```

The web UI provides an intuitive interface for configuring and generating feedback data with real-time metrics.
