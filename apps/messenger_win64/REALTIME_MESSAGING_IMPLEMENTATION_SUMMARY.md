# Real-time Messaging Backend Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of real-time messaging backend functionality for the CPC Messenger application, including WebSocket support, GraphQL subscriptions, and message editing/deletion capabilities.

## Features Implemented

### 1. WebSocket Server
- **File**: `apps/messenger_win64/src/infrastructure/websocket.rs`
- Implements real-time communication using `async-tungstenite` and `tokio`
- Supports broadcasting of reaction events, message updates, and message deletions
- Handles connection authentication and lifecycle management

### 2. GraphQL Schema Extensions
- **File**: `shared_packages/messenger/src/graphql.rs`
- Added mutations for message editing and deletion
- Added subscriptions for real-time reaction events
- Created GraphQL object types for messages and reactions

### 3. Domain Model Updates
- **File**: `shared_packages/messenger/src/models.rs`
- Added `updated_at` field to Message model
- Added `update_content()` and `mark_deleted()` methods to Message
- Enhanced MessageContent enum with proper serialization

### 4. Service Interface Extensions
- **File**: `shared_packages/messenger/src/services.rs`
- Added `update_message()` method to MessageService trait
- Updated method signatures to support message editing functionality

### 5. Dependency Updates
- **Files**: 
  - `shared_packages/messenger/Cargo.toml`
  - `apps/messenger_win64/Cargo.toml`
- Added `async-tungstenite` and related dependencies
- Added GraphQL-related dependencies with feature flags
- Configured proper module paths

### 6. Application Integration
- **File**: `apps/messenger_win64/src/main.rs`
- Integrated WebSocket server into the main application
- Updated GraphQL schema initialization to include new mutations and subscriptions
- Simplified application state management

### 7. Integration Tests
- **Files**:
  - `apps/messenger_win64/tests/websocket_test.rs`
  - `apps/messenger_win64/tests/graphql_test.rs`
- Created tests for WebSocket server functionality
- Created tests for GraphQL schema structure
- Verified event broadcasting mechanisms

## Key Components

### WebSocket Events
The WebSocket server supports the following event types:
- `ReactionAdded` - Broadcast when a reaction is added to a message
- `ReactionRemoved` - Broadcast when a reaction is removed from a message
- `MessageUpdated` - Broadcast when a message is edited
- `MessageDeleted` - Broadcast when a message is deleted
- `Connected` - Acknowledgment event for new connections

### GraphQL Schema
The extended GraphQL schema includes:
- **Mutations**:
  - `update_message` - Edit message content
  - `delete_message` - Delete a message
- **Subscriptions**:
  - `reaction_events` - Subscribe to reaction events for a message

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture
The implementation follows hexagonal architecture principles:
- Domain logic is separated in `shared_packages/messenger`
- Infrastructure implementations are in `apps/messenger_win64/src/infrastructure`
- Application services are in `apps/messenger_win64/src/services`

### Real-time Communication
Real-time updates are achieved through:
1. WebSocket connections for immediate client updates
2. Broadcast channels for internal event distribution
3. GraphQL subscriptions for client-side event streaming

### Data Consistency
Message editing and deletion use soft-delete patterns:
- Edited messages update content and set `updated_at` timestamp
- Deleted messages replace content with "[Deleted]" marker
- All changes are broadcast to connected clients in real-time

## Future Enhancements
- Implement full message history tracking
- Add support for message threading in real-time updates
- Enhance authentication and authorization for WebSocket connections
- Add support for presence indicators and typing notifications
