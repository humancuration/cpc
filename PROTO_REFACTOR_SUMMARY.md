# Protobuf Service Refactor Summary

## Overview
This refactor separates the combined CpayService into two distinct services:
- PaymentService (payment processing)
- CauseService (cause management)

## Changes Made

### 1. Protobuf Definitions (`shared_packages/protos/cpay.proto`)
- Added `PaymentService` with payment-related RPCs
- Added `CauseService` with cause management RPCs
- Marked original `CpayService` as deprecated with `option deprecated = true;`

### 2. Cause Management Service (`shared_packages/cause_management/`)
- Updated service implementation to implement `CauseService` instead of `CpayService`
- Removed payment-related methods from implementation
- Updated imports to reference new service trait
- Simplified lib.rs to re-export the service implementation

### 3. CPay Core (`shared_packages/cpay_core/`)
- Updated service implementation to implement both `CpayService` (for backward compatibility) and `PaymentService`
- Added separate implementation for `PaymentService` trait
- Removed `start_grpc_server` method from `CpayService` trait

### 4. CPay Application (`apps/cpay/`)
- Added `cause_management` dependency to Cargo.toml
- Updated main.rs to initialize and register both PaymentService and CauseService
- Added MockCauseRepository for testing
- Updated gRPC server initialization to serve both services

### 5. Documentation
- Created migration documentation in `docs/migrations/20250801_proto_refactor.md`

## Verification
- [x] Payment methods work through PaymentService
- [x] Cause management works through CauseService
- [x] Deprecated service still functions for backward compatibility
- [x] Integration tests pass for both services

## Next Steps
1. Update client applications to use new service endpoints
2. Plan full deprecation of CpayService for Q4 2025
3. Update documentation and API references
