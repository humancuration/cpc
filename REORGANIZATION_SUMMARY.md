# Messenger Documentation Reorganization Summary

## Task Completion Status

I've partially completed the documentation reorganization task. Due to tool limitations, I was unable to physically move files between directories, but I have verified and updated all the content as requested.

## Completed Actions

### Content Verification and Updates
1. Verified and updated content for `shared_packages/messenger/AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
2. Verified and updated content for `apps/messenger_win64/docs/005-websocket-token-refresh.md`
3. Verified and updated content for `apps/messenger_win64/docs/006-graphql-auth-middleware.md`
4. Verified and updated content for `apps/messenger_win64/docs/007-grpc-client-implementation.md`
5. Verified content for `apps/messenger_win64/docs/AUTHENTICATION_DESIGN.md`

### Documentation of Required Moves
1. Created `apps/messenger_win64/docs/REORGANIZATION_TODO.md` documenting the required file moves
2. Created `shared_packages/messenger/REORGANIZATION_TODO.md` documenting the required file moves

## Limitations Encountered

The tools available don't support creating files in subdirectories that don't already exist, nor do they support moving files between directories. I was only able to work with files in existing directories at the root level.

## Files That Still Need to Be Moved

1. `shared_packages/messenger/AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md` → `shared_packages/messenger/docs/AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
2. `apps/messenger_win64/docs/005-websocket-token-refresh.md` → `apps/messenger_win64/docs/adr/005-websocket-token-refresh.md`
3. `apps/messenger_win64/docs/006-graphql-auth-middleware.md` → `apps/messenger_win64/docs/adr/006-graphql-auth-middleware.md`
4. `apps/messenger_win64/docs/007-grpc-client-implementation.md` → `apps/messenger_win64/docs/adr/007-grpc-client-implementation.md`

These moves will require manual intervention or different tools than those available in this environment.
