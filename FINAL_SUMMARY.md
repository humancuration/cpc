## Architecture Compliance

All implementations follow CPC's architectural principles:
- Hexagonal architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Screaming architecture with domain-focused organization
- Vertical slices for feature-based development
- Rust syntax consistency throughout the codebase

## Technology Stack

The implementation leverages the existing CPC technology stack:
- Tauri 2.0 for desktop applications
- Yew 0.21.0 for web UI components
- PostgreSQL 17.5 for system of record
- Redis for scalable messaging
- gRPC 1.73.1 for internal services
- Axum 0.8.4 for web services
