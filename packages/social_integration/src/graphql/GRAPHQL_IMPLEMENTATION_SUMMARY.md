# GraphQL API Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the GraphQL API for tipping functionality in the social integration system.

## Overview

A GraphQL API has been implemented to provide access to tipping functionality, allowing users to send tips and query their tip transaction history.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. GraphQL Schema

- Defined GraphQL types for Money, Currency, TipTransaction, and related types
- Implemented QueryRoot with `tipTransactionsByUser` query
- Implemented MutationRoot with `sendTip` mutation
- Created a schema factory function `create_schema`

### 2. GraphQL Types

- `Money`: Represents monetary value with amount and currency
- `Currency`: Enum of supported currencies (DAB, USD, EUR, GBP, JPY)
- `TipTransaction`: Represents a tip transaction with sender, recipient, amount, note, and timestamp
- `TipTransactionConnection`: Paginated list of tip transactions
- `TipTransactionEdge`: Edge containing a tip transaction and cursor
- `PageInfo`: Information about pagination
- `MoneyInput`: Input type for money values

### 3. GraphQL Queries

- `tipTransactionsByUser`: Query tip transactions for a user with pagination
  - Requires authentication
  - Users can only query their own tip history
  - Supports pagination with `first` and `after` parameters

### 4. GraphQL Mutations

- `sendTip`: Send a tip from the authenticated user to another user
  - Requires authentication
  - Users can only send tips from their own account
  - Validates tip amount is positive
  - Validates note length is ≤ 200 characters
  - Validates currency is supported

### 5. Error Handling

- Custom GraphQL error types for different error scenarios:
  - Unauthorized
  - Forbidden
  - InvalidInput
  - InternalServerError
  - NotImplemented

### 6. Authorization

- Middleware to ensure users can only access their own data
- Users can only query their own tip history
- Users can only send tips from their own account

### 7. Input Validation

- Tip amount must be positive
- Currency must be supported
- Note length must be ≤ 200 characters

## Integration with Existing Services

- Uses `TipService` for business logic
- Uses `WalletService` for fund transfers
- Works with existing `TipTransactionRepository` for data access

## Testing

- Created integration tests for GraphQL queries and mutations
- Tests cover successful operations and error cases
- Tests use mock services for isolation

## Usage

The GraphQL API can be used to send tips and query tip transaction history:

```graphql
# Send a tip
mutation SendTip($recipientId: ID!, $amount: MoneyInput!, $note: String) {
  sendTip(recipientId: $recipientId, amount: $amount, note: $note) {
    id
    senderId
    recipientId
    amount {
      amount
      currency
    }
    note
    createdAt
  }
}

# Query tip history
query GetTipHistory($userId: ID!, $first: Int, $after: String) {
  tipTransactionsByUser(userId: $userId, first: $first, after: $after) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        senderId
        recipientId
        amount {
          amount
          currency
        }
        note
        createdAt
      }
      cursor
    }
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      endCursor
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Standardized API**: GraphQL provides a standardized way to access tipping functionality
2. **Flexible Queries**: Clients can request exactly the data they need
3. **Real-time Updates**: GraphQL subscriptions can be added for real-time updates
4. **Type Safety**: Strong typing ensures data consistency
5. **Authorization**: Built-in authorization ensures data security
6. **Validation**: Input validation prevents invalid operations
