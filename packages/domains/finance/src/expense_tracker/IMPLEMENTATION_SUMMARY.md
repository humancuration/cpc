# Expense Tracker Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the key changes made to bring the Expense Tracker module into full compliance with the architectural design.

## 1. Traditional Currency Support

### Changes Made:
- Added `add_traditional_currency` and `subtract_traditional_currency` methods to the `WalletService` trait and implementation
- Modified the `Wallet` domain model to support traditional currency operations
- Updated the `create_expense` method in `ExpenseService` to handle both Dabloons and traditional currencies
- Modified budget linking to only apply to Dabloons, as traditional currency isn't tracked in budgets

### Key Files Modified:
- `packages/cpc-core/finance/src/application/wallet_service.rs`
- `packages/cpc-core/finance/src/domain/wallet.rs`
- `packages/cpc-core/finance/src/expense_tracker/application/expense_service.rs`

## 2. OCR Implementation

### Changes Made:
- Added `tesseract`, `image`, and `base64` dependencies to `packages/cpc-core/Cargo.toml`
- Implemented actual OCR processing using the Tesseract library in the receipt processor
- Improved parsing logic for merchant name, date, and amount
- Added category classification functionality based on merchant name and items
- Updated the `process_receipt` method in `ExpenseService` to use the new OCR and classification functionality

### Key Files Modified:
- `packages/cpc-core/Cargo.toml`
- `packages/cpc-core/finance/src/expense_tracker/infrastructure/ocr/receipt_processor.rs`
- `packages/cpc-core/finance/src/expense_tracker/application/expense_service.rs`

## 3. Privacy Control Enhancements

### Changes Made:
- Extended `ExpenseSharingPreferences` domain model with time limits and recipient-specific rules
- Updated the database schema to support the new privacy features
- Modified the `update_sharing_preferences` method in `ExpenseService` to handle the new parameters
- Updated documentation to reflect the new privacy features

### Key Files Modified:
- `packages/cpc-core/finance/src/expense_tracker/domain/mod.rs`
- `packages/cpc-core/migrations/20250728000015_add_expense_tracker_tables.sql`
- `packages/cpc-core/finance/src/expense_tracker/application/expense_service.rs`
- `packages/cpc-core/finance/src/expense_tracker/README.md`

## Conclusion

The Expense Tracker module now fully supports:
- Dual-currency operations (Dabloons and traditional currencies)
- Actual OCR processing with category classification
- Enhanced privacy controls with time limits and recipient-specific rules

These changes bring the implementation into full compliance with the architectural design while delivering the promised user functionality.
