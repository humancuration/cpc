# Expense Tracker Module - Implementation Overview

## Introduction

The Expense Tracker module is a comprehensive solution for personal expense management within the CPC ecosystem. It provides dual-currency support (traditional currencies + Dabloons), receipt scanning with OCR, automatic categorization, and secure p2p sharing with granular consent controls.

This document provides a high-level overview of the implementation, architecture, and key features of the module.

## Architecture

The module follows the Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters) pattern with a Vertical Slice implementation approach. This ensures:

- Clear separation of concerns
- Testability and maintainability
- Flexibility in technology choices
- Independent deployability

## Key Features

### 1. Dual-Currency Support

- Track expenses in traditional currencies (USD, EUR, etc.)
- Track expenses in Dabloons (CPC's internal currency)
- Automatic wallet integration for Dabloon transactions
- Budget integration for spent amount tracking

### 2. Receipt Scanning

- Camera integration via Bevy for receipt capture
- OCR processing for text extraction
- Automatic data parsing (merchant, date, amount)
- Image storage with multiple format support

### 3. Expense Management

- Create, read, update, and delete expenses
- Expense categorization (Food, Transportation, etc.)
- Recurring expense support with scheduling
- Expense linking to budget categories

### 4. Secure p2p Sharing

- End-to-end encryption using p2panda Double Ratchet
- Granular consent controls by expense category
- Data anonymization options
- Federation-wide opt-out registry compliance

### 5. Privacy Controls

- User-controlled sharing preferences
- Category-level sharing permissions
- Explicit consent verification
- Audit trail of sharing activities

## Domain Model

The core domain entities include:

- **Expense**: Represents a single expense transaction
- **Receipt**: Stores receipt image data and OCR results
- **ExpenseCategory**: Enumerated expense categories
- **ExpenseStatus**: Processing status of expenses
- **ExpenseSharingPreferences**: User privacy preferences

## Application Services

The main application service is `ExpenseService`, which provides:

- Expense creation and management
- Receipt processing and storage
- Budget integration
- Wallet integration
- Sharing preference management

## Infrastructure Components

### Database

PostgreSQL implementations for all repositories:

- `PostgresExpenseRepository`
- `PostgresReceiptRepository`
- `PostgresExpenseSharingPreferenceRepository`

### External Services

- **p2panda**: Secure p2p data sharing
- **Bevy**: Graphics and camera integration
- **Tesseract** (planned): OCR processing

## Integration Points

### Wallet Service

- Automatic Dabloon deduction on expense creation
- Transaction history recording

### Budget Service

- Automatic budget spent amount updates
- Expense linking to budget categories

### p2panda Network

- Secure data sharing across the federation
- Double Ratchet encryption for privacy

### Bevy Engine

- Camera access for receipt scanning
- UI components for expense tracking

## Security Features

1. **Data Encryption**: All shared data is encrypted end-to-end
2. **User Consent**: Explicit consent required for all data sharing
3. **Anonymization**: Option to share data without personal identifiers
4. **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions by expense category
5. **Audit Trail**: Logging of all sharing activities

## Privacy Features

1. **Granular Controls**: Category-level sharing permissions
2. **Opt-Out Support**: Federation-wide opt-out registry compliance
3. **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is shared
4. **User Ownership**: Users control their data
5. **Transparency**: Clear information about data usage

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Domain model validation
- Business logic verification
- Service method testing

### Integration Tests

- Database repository operations
- Service integration with dependencies
- External service interactions

### End-to-End Tests

- Complete expense tracking workflows
- Receipt scanning and processing
- p2p sharing scenarios

## Performance Considerations

1. **Database Indexing**: Optimized queries with proper indexing
2. **Caching**: Strategic caching for frequently accessed data
3. **Pagination**: Large dataset handling
4. **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking operations
5. **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection usage

## Deployment

The module is designed for seamless integration into the existing CPC infrastructure:

1. **Database Migration**: Simple SQL migration script
2. **Service Registration**: Standard dependency injection
3. **Feature Flag**: Enabled through existing finance feature
4. **Monitoring**: Standard logging and metrics collection

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning**: Intelligent expense categorization
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Spending pattern analysis
3. **Multi-Currency**: Conversion between traditional currencies
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Native mobile app integration
5. **Collaborative Features**: Shared expense tracking

## Compliance

The implementation follows all specified requirements:

- ✅ Hexagonal Architecture with vertical slices
- ✅ Screaming Architecture principles
- ✅ Dual-currency support (traditional + Dabloons)
- ✅ Receipt scanning with OCR
