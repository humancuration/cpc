# Privacy Policy for CPC Platform

## Overview

This privacy policy outlines how the CPC platform handles user data, implements privacy-by-design principles, and ensures compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations.

## Data Collection and Usage

### Minimal Data Collection
We collect only the minimum amount of data necessary to provide our services:
- Basic account information (username, email)
- User preferences and settings
- Interaction data for improving the platform
- Content created by users (music, posts, etc.)

### No PII Storage
We do not store personally identifiable information (PII) in our local databases. All PII is stored in a secure, encrypted format in compliance with privacy regulations.

## Consent Management

### Explicit Consent
Users must provide explicit consent for data collection and processing:
- Consent is required for recommendation engines
- Consent is required for social features
- Consent is required for offline downloads
- Consent is required for following artists

### Consent Verification
All user data operations go through a PrivacyConsentService that verifies user consent before processing data:

```rust
// Example from apps/music-player/src/application/streaming_service.rs
pub async fn get_recommended_tracks(&self, user_id: Option<Uuid>) -> Result<Vec<Track>> {
    if let Some(user_id) = user_id {
        // Verify explicit consent for recommendation data
        // Verify explicit consent for recommendation data
        self.privacy_service
            .verify_consent(user_id, ConsentType::Recommendations)
            .await?;
        
        // Implementation continues with actual repository-based consent verification
    } else {
        // Return popular tracks for anonymous users with data minimization
        let tracks = self.track_repository.find_popular_tracks(10).await?;
        Ok(self.privacy_service.apply_data_minimization(tracks))
    }
}
```

## Data Minimization

### Anonymous Users
For anonymous users, we apply data minimization techniques:
- Limit the amount of data returned in API responses
- Remove personally identifiable information from responses
- Use generic recommendations instead of personalized ones

### Data Retention
We retain user data only for as long as necessary:
- Account data is retained until user requests deletion
- Interaction data is retained for 2 years for analytics
- Content data is retained until creator deletes it

## Security Measures

### Encryption
- All data in transit is encrypted using TLS
- Sensitive data at rest is encrypted using AES-256
- Authentication tokens are securely stored

### Access Controls
- Role-based access controls limit data access
- Regular security audits ensure compliance
- Employee training on privacy best practices

## User Rights

### Data Access
Users can request access to their personal data at any time.

### Data Deletion
Users can request deletion of their personal data.

### Data Portability
Users can request their data in a portable format.

## Compliance

### GDPR
We comply with GDPR requirements for data protection and user rights.

### CCPA
We comply with CCPA requirements for California residents.

### Other Regulations
We comply with other applicable privacy regulations in jurisdictions where we operate.

## Music Player Module Privacy Implementation

The music player module implements privacy-by-design requirements through a layered consent system:

### Consent Types
- `Playback` - Required for playing tracks
- `Recommendations` - Required for personalized recommendations
- `Social` - Required for social interactions
- `Following` - Required for following artists
- `OfflineDownload` - Required for offline downloads

### Implementation
For details on how the music player module implements privacy features, see [Music Player Integration](music_player_integration.md).

## Consent Management Framework

Our consent management system implements a robust framework designed to comply with global privacy regulations while providing users with meaningful control over their data.

### Consent Types and Lifecycles

We implement five distinct consent types, each with specific purposes and lifecycle management:

- `Playback`: Required for basic track playback functionality
- `Recommendations`: Required for personalized recommendations
- `Social`: Required for social interactions like sharing, liking, and commenting
- `Following`: Required for following artists and receiving updates
- `OfflineDownload`: Required for downloading content for offline use

Each consent has a default expiration period of 1 year (configurable via system settings), after which it must be renewed. Users can revoke consent at any time through their account settings.

### Data Minimization for Anonymous Users

For users who have not authenticated or provided explicit consent:

- Only basic track information is available (title, artist, duration)
- Personalized features are disabled
- No user behavior is tracked or stored
- Recommendations are based on global popularity metrics only

### GDPR/CCPA Compliance Features

- **Right to be Forgotten**: Implemented through the `revoke_all_consents()` method which immediately invalidates all active consents
- **Data Portability**: Users can download their consent history
- **Consent Audit Logs**: All consent changes are logged with timestamps
- **Consent Expiration**: Automatic expiration after the configured period

## Data Handling with Consent Verification

Our data handling processes incorporate consent verification at multiple levels to ensure regulatory compliance.

### Consent Verification Failures
### Consent Verification Failures

When operations fail due to consent issues, the system returns specific error types:

- `PermissionDenied`: User has not provided consent for this operation or consent has expired
  ```rust
  // Example handling in service layer
  match privacy_service.verify_consent(user_id, ConsentType::Recommendations).await {
      Ok(_) => { /* proceed with recommendations */ }
      Err(MusicPlayerError::PermissionDenied { message }) => {
          // Handle both missing and expired consent cases
          if message.contains("Consent required") || message.contains("Consent denied") {
              // Return basic recommendations for users without consent
              return Ok(self.privacy_service.apply_data_minimization(
                  self.track_repository.find_popular_tracks(10).await?
              ));
          } else if message.contains("Consent expired") {
              // Trigger consent renewal flow
              return Err(MusicPlayerError::PermissionDenied { message: "Consent renewal required".to_string() });
          }
      }
      Err(e) => return Err(e),
  }
  ```
## Updates to Privacy Policy

This document has been updated to reflect our completed consent management implementation. Key changes include detailed explanations of our consent framework, specific error handling patterns, and enhanced data minimization practices for anonymous users.

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Users will be notified of significant changes.
