# Privacy Policy for CPC Platform

## Overview

This privacy policy outlines how the CPC platform handles user data, implements privacy-by-design principles, and ensures compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations.

## Data Collection and Usage

### Minimal Data Collection
We collect only the minimum amount of data necessary to provide our services:
- Basic account information (username, email)
- User preferences and settings
- Interaction data for improving the platform
- Content created by users (music, posts, etc.)

BUT if a user opts-in to data collection, the system can and will collect extremely fine-grained data of all kinds, with advanced telemetry. Our entire platform will lean heavily into this.

### PII Storage
We do not store personally identifiable information (PII) in our local databases unless they consent. All PII is stored in a secure, encrypted format in compliance with privacy regulations.

## Consent Management

### Explicit Consent
Users must provide explicit consent for data collection and processing:

There will be checkboxes in the privacy options for which data users want to share. But their personal information, shopping habits, medical information, etc can be used to help the federation, so it will be encouraged. We can improve the services offered by cooperatives within the federation. We can use that data to create data lakes to train coopy-left licensed AI on, so we should create different data lakes of different types for easy sorting. Information from an individual should be anonymized but grouped together for research that requires it, as specific data can highlight nuance in various interconnected datapoints. Everyone within the federation who want to use data for their endeavors can do so as well under a specific coopyleft license which we will develop.

### Consent Verification
All user data operations go through a PrivacyConsentService that verifies user consent before processing data:

## Data Minimization

### Anonymous Users
For anonymous users, we apply data minimization techniques:
- Limit the amount of data returned in API responses
- Remove personally identifiable information from responses
- Use generic recommendations instead of personalized ones

## For Data Sharing Users
We store all of the data types they consent to.
- Advanced telemetry
- Many datapoints for every type they allow
- Used to improve BI, AI, recommendation AI, supply chains, etc.

### Data Retention
We retain user data only for as long as necessary:
- Account data is retained until user requests deletion
- Content data is retained until creator deletes it

## Security Measures

### Encryption
- All data in transit is encrypted using TLS
- Sensitive data at rest is encrypted using AES-256
- Authentication tokens are securely stored

### Access Controls
- Role-based access controls limit data access
- Regular security audits ensure compliance
- Employee training on privacy best practices

## User Rights

### Data Access
Users can request access to their personal data at any time.

### Data Deletion
Users can request deletion of their personal data.

### Data Portability
Users can request their data in a portable format.

## Compliance

### GDPR
We comply with GDPR requirements for data protection and user rights.

### CCPA
We comply with CCPA requirements for California residents.

### Other Regulations
We comply with other applicable privacy regulations in jurisdictions where we operate.

## Consent Management Framework

Our consent management system implements a robust framework designed to comply with global privacy regulations while providing users with meaningful control over their data.

### GDPR/CCPA Compliance Features

- **Right to be Forgotten**: Implemented through the `revoke_all_consents()` method which immediately invalidates all active consents
- **Data Portability**: Users can download their consent history
- **Consent Audit Logs**: All consent changes are logged with timestamps
- **Consent Expiration**: Automatic expiration after the configured period

## Data Handling with Consent Verification

Our data handling processes incorporate consent verification at multiple levels to ensure regulatory compliance.

### Consent Verification Failures

When operations fail due to consent issues, the system returns specific error types:

- `PermissionDenied`: User has not provided consent for this operation or consent has expired
  ```rust
  // Example handling in service layer
  match privacy_service.verify_consent(user_id, ConsentType::Recommendations).await {
      Ok(_) => { /* proceed with recommendations */ }
      Err(MusicPlayerError::PermissionDenied { message }) => {
          // Handle both missing and expired consent cases
          if message.contains("Consent required") || message.contains("Consent denied") {
              // Return basic recommendations for users without consent
              return Ok(self.privacy_service.apply_data_minimization(
                  self.track_repository.find_popular_tracks(10).await?
              ));
          } else if message.contains("Consent expired") {
              // Trigger consent renewal flow
              return Err(MusicPlayerError::PermissionDenied { message: "Consent renewal required".to_string() });
          }
      }
      Err(e) => return Err(e),
  }
  ```
## Updates to Privacy Policy

This document has been updated to reflect our completed consent management implementation. Key changes include detailed explanations of our consent framework, specific error handling patterns, and enhanced data minimization practices for anonymous users.

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Users will be notified of significant changes.
