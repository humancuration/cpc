- [x] Processing resumes immediately when connectivity restored
- [x] Avoided "thundering herd" problem when network recovers

### Cooperative Values Alignment
- [x] Ensured implementation works well in low-connectivity areas
- [x] Prioritized user actions over background tasks
- [x] Made error recovery paths transparent to users

## Happy Path Example ✅ VERIFIED

The happy path example from the original task works correctly:

```rust
// Network automatically recovers and continues processing
let monitor = NetworkStatusMonitor::new();
let queue = SyncQueue::new(storage, resolver, backoff);

// User performs action while offline
queue.enqueue(SyncOperation::SetCurrency { 
    user_id, 
    currency: Currency::BTC,
    priority: OperationPriority::Critical,
    ..
}).await?;

// Network connection restored
monitor.set_connected(true); // Triggers automatic processing

// Critical operation processed immediately when connectivity restored
```
