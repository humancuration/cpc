## Implementation Details

### Type System
The new type system is implemented in `src/types.rs` and includes:
- `Type` enum with variants for scalars, composites, streams, events, structs, enums, and generics
- `Type::parse()` method for parsing type strings
- `Type::is_compatible_with()` method for type compatibility checking
- `GenericBound` enum for generic parameter bounds
- Bounds validation for generic types

### Graph Validation
Graph validation is implemented in `src/validator.rs` and includes:
- `validate_edge()` function for validating individual edges
- `validate_graph_structure()` function for validating overall graph structure
- Stream merge policy validation for multiple producers
- Type compatibility checking between connected ports

### Registry Enhancements
The registry in `src/model.rs` has been enhanced with:
- Support for graph specifications and handles
- Graph indexing and lookup methods
- Graph validation integration

## Next Steps

### 1. Cycle Detection
- Implement cycle detection in graphs using DFS or similar algorithms
- Add validation to prevent cycles in graph dependencies

### 2. Advanced Stream Features
- Implement more sophisticated stream merge policies (Zip, Map, Filter)
- Add support for stream backpressure and buffering policies
- Implement stream type inference and validation

### 3. Error Handling
- Improve error messages for type incompatibility
- Add more detailed error reporting for graph validation failures
- Implement error recovery suggestions

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Optimize type parsing and compatibility checking
- Implement caching for frequently used type checks
- Add parallel validation for large graphs

### 5. Documentation
- Add more detailed documentation for the type system
- Create examples of complex type usage
- Document graph validation rules and best practices

### 6. Tooling
- Create a CLI tool for validating modules and graphs
- Add IDE integration for type checking and validation
- Implement a visual graph editor with validation feedback

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test all type parsing and validation scenarios
- Test individual graph validation functions
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Integration Tests
- Test complete module loading and validation
- Test complex graph structures with multiple producers
- Test generic type instantiation and bounds checking

### Example Tests
- Ensure all existing examples continue to work
- Add new examples demonstrating advanced features
- Test backward compatibility with v0.1 specifications

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Multiple Producer Detection**: The current implementation of multiple producer detection is simplified
2. **Cycle Detection**: Not yet implemented
3. **Advanced Stream Features**: Limited support for stream adapters beyond Merge

### Potential Issues
1. **Performance**: Type parsing could be slow for very complex types
2. **Memory Usage**: Large graphs may consume significant memory during validation
3. **Error Messages**: Some error messages could be more descriptive

## Future Directions

### Language Integration
- Integration with the Shtairir language parser
- Type inference for the Shtairir language
- Code generation from validated specifications

### Runtime Support
- Runtime type checking and validation
- Dynamic graph loading and validation
- Hot-reloading of modules and graphs

### Ecosystem Integration
- Integration with the CPC app ecosystem
- Support for shared libraries and modules
- Version resolution and dependency management

## Conclusion

The v0.2 implementation of the Shtairir Registry provides a solid foundation for type-safe graph-based programming with enhanced validation capabilities. The new type system and graph validation features enable more robust and expressive specifications while maintaining backward compatibility with existing v0.1 modules.

The next phase of development should focus on implementing cycle detection, advanced stream features, and improving the developer experience through better tooling and documentation.
