        self.graphs.insert(key, handle);
    }

    // Add this method to model.rs
    pub fn module_graph_names(&self, module: &str, version: &str) -> Vec<String> {
        self.modules
            .get(module)
            .and_then(|m| m.get(version))

            .or_insert_with(Vec::new)
            .push(edge.to.node.clone());
    }
    
    // Perform DFS to detect cycles
    let mut visited = HashSet::new();
    let mut recursion_stack = HashSet::new();
    let mut cycles = Vec::new();
    
    for node_id in graph.keys() {

                cycles.push(cycle);
            }
        }
    }
    
    Ok(cycles)
}
