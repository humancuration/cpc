# Shtairir v0.2 - Executive Summary

## Overview

Shtairir is a visual scripting language designed to enable the creation of modular, interoperable applications across our app ecosystem. This executive summary outlines the planned improvements for version 0.2, which will significantly enhance the language's capabilities and the ecosystem's modularity.

## Current State

Shtairir currently has a solid foundation with:
- Basic registry for managing modules, blocks, and graphs
- Core type system with scalars and basic composites
- Validation for blocks and graphs
- Support for purity and determinism annotations
- Basic port kinds (value, stream, event, composite)
- Integrity hashing for content verification

However, several key areas require improvement to reach our vision for a truly modular and interoperable ecosystem.

## Key Improvement Areas

### 1. Complete Registry Implementation

The registry needs completion to properly handle graphs as first-class citizens alongside blocks. This includes adding missing methods, improving indexing, and enhancing validation capabilities.

**Impact**: Enables proper module management for reusable components and facilitates graph discovery and versioning.

### 2. Enhanced Type System

The type system requires full support for Algebraic Data Types (ADTs), proper type compatibility checking, and generic bounds checking.

**Impact**: Enables rich data modeling, improves type safety, and facilitates the creation of reusable generic components.

### 3. Improved Visual Scripting Capabilities

We need to create a comprehensive set of adapter nodes, implement proper stream merge policies, and add support for composite port projections.

**Impact**: Enables rich data transformations without custom blocks, reduces boilerplate code, and improves graph readability.

### 4. Enhanced Execution Model

The execution model needs a deterministic scheduler, async handling for effectful blocks, and proper backpressure handling.

**Impact**: Ensures predictable behavior, enables integration with external systems, and prevents resource exhaustion.

### 5. More Example Blocks and Graphs

We need to create examples demonstrating advanced features, effects handling, and stream processing patterns.

**Impact**: Provides patterns for developers to follow, accelerates development, and improves adoption of advanced features.

### 6. Improved Interoperability

We need to design an FFI interface for Rust blocks, create a WASM target specification, and implement serialization for all types.

**Impact**: Enables native Rust implementation, cross-platform deployment, and seamless data exchange.

## Implementation Approach

We'll implement these improvements in five prioritized phases:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (7 weeks)
- Complete registry implementation
- Enhance type system
- Improve validator
