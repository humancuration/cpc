# Manual File Moves Summary

This document summarizes the progress made on the file moves specified in docs/MANUAL_FILE_MOVES.md.

## Completed Actions

1. Added moved notices to all original files:
   - shared_packages/messenger/AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md
   - apps/messenger_win64/docs/005-websocket-token-refresh.md
   - apps/messenger_win64/docs/006-graphql-auth-middleware.md
   - apps/messenger_win64/docs/007-grpc-client-implementation.md

## Incomplete Actions

1. Creating new files in destination locations:
   - shared_packages/messenger/docs/AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md
   - apps/messenger_win64/docs/adr/005-websocket-token-refresh.md
   - apps/messenger_win64/docs/adr/006-graphql-auth-middleware.md
   - apps/messenger_win64/docs/adr/007-grpc-client-implementation.md

The file creation step was not possible due to tool limitations with the write_to_file function, which is unable to create files in directories even when they exist.

## Next Steps

1. Manual file creation will be needed for the destination files
2. No internal links were found between these files that needed updating
