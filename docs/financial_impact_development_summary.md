## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Modular Architecture
We adopted a hexagonal architecture with the following modules:
- **tracker**: Core tracking functionality
- **analytics**: Metrics processing and dashboard generation
- **feedback**: Community feedback collection and analysis
- **improvement**: Continuous improvement mechanisms
- **integration**: Cross-system impact analysis

This modular approach allows for:
- Independent development and testing of components
- Reusability across different applications
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier maintenance and enhancement

### 2. Privacy-First Approach
All components respect user consent preferences:
- Configurable data sharing levels
- Transparent data collection practices
- Secure data transmission
- Minimal data retention policies

### 3. Real-Time Analytics
The system provides real-time insights through:
- In-memory data structures for fast access
- Async/await patterns for non-blocking operations
- WebSocket support for live updates (planned)
- Caching mechanisms for improved performance

### 4. Cross-System Integration
The integration module enables:
- Learning system correlation analysis
- Volunteer coordination impact measurement
- Cause management system connections
- Holistic community engagement metrics
