# Real-time Collaborative Cursors - Phase 1 Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of Phase 1 (Coordinate system & viewport sync) of the real-time collaborative cursors feature.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced PositionTranslator

The `PositionTranslator` has been enhanced to support variable fonts and layouts:

- Added `LineMetrics` and `CharMetrics` structs for detailed font/layout measurements
- Implemented measurement caching using LRU cache for performance
- Added spatial indexing support for efficient screen-to-document conversions
- Added `Rect` struct for viewport representations
- Extended API with methods for updating font/line metrics and viewport management

### 2. Viewport Synchronization System

A new `ViewportSyncManager` has been created to handle viewport synchronization:

- Implements scroll/resize listeners (conceptual - would be integrated with UI events)
- Delta compression to only send meaningful viewport changes
- Throttling mechanism with 250ms minimum between updates
- Extended signaling protocol with `ViewportUpdate` message

### 3. Updated PresenceStateManager

The `PresenceStateManager` has been updated to track viewport information:

- Added viewport tracking to `UserPresenceState`
- Added resolution levels for Level of Detail (LOD) support
- Extended converter functions to handle viewport updates

### 4. Unit Tests

Comprehensive unit tests have been created for:

- Coordinate translation with various fonts and layouts
- Viewport delta compression algorithms
- Throttling behavior for viewport updates
- Rectangle operations and similarity calculations

## Files Modified/Added

### Shared Packages
- `shared_packages/realtime_signaling/src/message.rs` - Added `ViewportUpdate` and `Rect` message types

- `apps/document_editor/src/presentation/viewport_sync.rs` - New module for viewport synchronization
- `apps/document_editor/src/presentation/editor_with_presence.rs` - Integrated viewport update handling
- `apps/document_editor/src/presentation/mod.rs` - Updated module exports
- `apps/document_editor/src/presentation/position_translator_test.rs` - Unit tests for position translator
- `apps/document_editor/src/presentation/coordinate_translation_tests.rs` - Tests for coordinate translation
- `apps/document_editor/src/presentation/viewport_sync_test.rs` - Tests for viewport synchronization

## Technical Details

### Position Translation Enhancements

The enhanced `PositionTranslator` now supports:

1. **Variable Font Metrics**: Tracks different character widths and kerning for different fonts
2. **Line Metrics**: Handles line heights, wrapping, and positioning
3. **Caching**: Uses LRU cache to avoid repeated calculations
4. **Viewport Management**: Tracks scroll position and viewport dimensions

### Viewport Synchronization

The `ViewportSyncManager` implements:

1. **Delta Compression**: Only sends updates when viewport changes significantly (configurable threshold)
2. **Throttling**: Limits updates to a maximum frequency (default 250ms)
3. **Resolution Levels**: Supports Level of Detail for performance optimization

### Presence State Enhancements

The `UserPresenceState` now tracks:

1. **Viewport Information**: Current visible region for each user
2. **Resolution Levels**: LOD information for rendering optimization
3. **Updated Converters**: Handle conversion between signaling messages and presence state

## Testing

Unit tests cover:

1. **Coordinate Translation**: Various font sizes, wrapping scenarios, and scroll positions
2. **Viewport Synchronization**: Delta compression accuracy and throttling behavior
3. **Rectangle Operations**: Intersection calculations and similarity measurements

## Next Steps

This Phase 1 implementation provides the foundation for real-time collaborative cursors. Future phases will build on this work to implement:

- Cursor interpolation and prediction
- Performance optimizations (occlusion culling, LOD rendering)
- Visual feedback and cursor styles
