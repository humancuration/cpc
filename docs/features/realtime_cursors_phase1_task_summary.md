## Implementation Details

### Position Translation Enhancements
The `PositionTranslator` was enhanced with:
- Detailed font metrics tracking (character width, kerning)
- Line metrics (height, wrapping information)
- LRU-based caching for performance
- Viewport and scroll position tracking
- Bidirectional document/screen coordinate conversion

### Viewport Synchronization
The `ViewportSyncManager` implements:
- Change detection using rectangle similarity calculations
- Time-based throttling (250ms minimum between updates)
- Configurable sensitivity thresholds
- Resolution level tracking for LOD

### Presence State Management
The `UserPresenceState` was extended to track:
- Current viewport rectangle
- Resolution level for rendering optimization
- Updated converter functions for new data types

## Testing Approach
Comprehensive testing was implemented covering:
- Basic coordinate translation functionality
- Cache behavior and invalidation
- Viewport similarity and intersection calculations
- Throttling and delta compression behavior
- Integration between all components

## Next Steps
This Phase 1 implementation provides a solid foundation for real-time collaborative cursors. Future phases should focus on:
1. Cursor interpolation and prediction algorithms
2. Performance optimizations (occlusion culling, LOD rendering)
3. Visual feedback and cursor styling
4. Network optimization and bandwidth management

## Task Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - All Phase 1 requirements have been implemented and tested.
