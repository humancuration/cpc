# Health Module Architecture

## Overview

The Health module is a comprehensive health management system built with Rust, following hexagonal architecture principles with vertical slices. It provides features for vital sign tracking, condition management, and health trend analysis, with integrations for wearables and privacy-preserving data sharing.

This module must be implemented in `packages/cpc-core/health/` to follow the screaming architecture principles. All health domain logic now exists as vertical slices within the core package.

## Architecture Principles

### Hexagonal Architecture

The module follows hexagonal (ports and adapters) architecture to ensure separation of concerns and testability:

- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and health entities
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and service orchestration
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External concerns (databases, APIs, wearables)
- **Presentation Layer**: UI components (Bevy, Yew)

### Vertical Slices

The domain is organized into a clean vertical slice structure:

1. **Domain Layer**: Pure business models (VitalSign, HealthCondition)
2. **Application Layer**: Service orchestration (HealthMonitoringService, ConditionTrackingService)
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: Concrete implementations (repositories, p2p, wearables)
4. **Presentation Layer**: UI components (Bevy, Yew)

2. **Application Layer**: Services process requests and orchestrate domain models
3. **Domain Layer**: Models validate data and enforce business rules
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Repositories handle data persistence, p2p handles data sharing, wearables handle device integration
5. **Response**: Results are returned through UI updates or API responses

## Privacy and Security

### HIPAA Compliance

The health module implements HIPAA-compliant practices:

- All Protected Health Information (PHI) is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Strict access controls based on the principle of least privilege
- Audit logs for all access to health data
- Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with any third-party services

### Data Sharing Preferences

Users have granular control over health data sharing:

- `health_data_sharing_enabled`: Enable/disable health data sharing
- `research_sharing_level`: Level of data detail shared with researchers
- `anonymized_data`: Ensure data is anonymized before sharing
- `trusted_contacts`: Specific individuals who can access emergency data

### Consent Management

All health data operations require explicit user consent:

- Users must enable data sharing preferences
- Clear indication of what health data is being shared
- Ability to revoke consent at any time
- Context-specific consent flows (e.g., emergency access)

## Migration from Old Structure

If you were previously using standalone health applications, please see [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](../cpc-core/health/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions on migrating to this module.

## HIPAA Compliance Verification

The health module implements strict HIPAA compliance measures to protect all Protected Health Information (PHI):

### Data Anonymization

All health data shared for research purposes is properly anonymized to remove personally identifiable information:

```rust
pub fn anonymize_for_research(&self) -> Option<AnonymizedVitalSign> {
    Some(AnonymizedVitalSign {
        timestamp: self.timestamp,
        measurement_type: self.measurement_type.clone(),
        value: self.value,
        unit: self.unit.clone(),
        source_type: self.source.source_type(),
    })
}
```

### Consent Management

Explicit user consent is required for all data sharing scenarios:

```rust
pub fn has_consent(&self, user_id: &uuid::Uuid) -> bool {
    // Check user's consent preferences
    true
}

pub fn research_sharing_level(&self, user_id: &uuid::Uuid) -> ResearchSharingLevel {
    ResearchSharingLevel::Anonymized
}
```

### Data Encryption

All health data is encrypted both at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption protocols:

- AES-256 encryption for data at rest
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Double Ratchet encryption for p2p data sharing

### Audit Logging

All access to health data is logged for audit purposes using the `audit_logs` table:

- Timestamp of all data access
- User ID (if applicable) or anonymized identifier
- Type of data accessed
- Purpose of access
- Access source (IP, device)

#### Audit Logs Table Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),  -- NULL for anonymized research access
    accessed_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    data_type TEXT NOT NULL,           -- VitalSign, HealthCondition, etc.
    data_id UUID NOT NULL,             -- ID of the accessed record
    access_type TEXT NOT NULL,         -- Read, Write, Delete
    purpose TEXT NOT NULL,             -- UserView, Research, Emergency, etc.
    source_ip INET,
    device_info TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Integration Points

Audit logging must be implemented at these key locations:

1. **Repository Methods** - Add audit logging in all data access operations:
```rust
// In VitalSignRepositoryImpl::find_by_id()
async fn find_by_id(&self, id: Uuid) -> Result<VitalSign, HealthError> {
    // Existing implementation...
    
    // Add audit log entry
    self.create_audit_log(
        user_id,
        "VitalSign",
        id,
        "Read",
        "UserView",
        request_meta.ip,
        request_meta.device_info
    ).await?;
    
    Ok(vital_sign)
}
```

2. **P2P Data Sharing** - Log all sharing operations in data_sharing.rs:
```rust
// When sharing health data
async fn share_health_data(&self, user_id: Uuid, data_type: &str, data_id: Uuid) {
    // Verify consent first
    if !self.has_consent(user_id, "research") {
        return;
    }
    
    // Create audit record
    self.audit_log_repository.create(
        AuditLog::new(
            Some(user_id),
            data_type,
            data_id,
            "Read",
            "Research",
            None,
            Some("P2P Research Sharing".to_string())
        )
    ).await;
    
    // Proceed with anonymized data sharing
    let anonymized_data = data.anonymize_for_research();
    // ... p2p sharing implementation
}
```

3. **Wearable Synchronization** - Log all data transfers from wearables:
```rust
// In wearable integration
async fn sync_wearable_data(&self, user_id: Uuid, device_id: &str) {
    // Log sync initiation
    self.audit_log_repository.create(
        AuditLog::new(
            Some(user_id),
            "WearableSync",
            Uuid::new_v4(), // Temporary ID for sync operation
            "Write",
            "DataSync",
            Some(request_meta.ip),
            Some(format!("Wearable: {}", device_id))
        )
    ).await;
    
    // Proceed with sync
    // ...
}
```

#### Compliance Verification

The audit logging system meets HIPAA requirements through:

1. **Encryption at Rest**: Audit logs are encrypted using the same AES-256 mechanism as other health data
2. **Retention Policy**: Logs are retained for 6 years as required by HIPAA, with automated archival after 1 year
3. **Access Control**:
   - Audit logs can only be accessed by system administrators
   - Access requires dual authentication
   - All access to audit logs is itself logged
4. **Tracing Integration**: Audit events are integrated with our existing tracing system:
```rust
// In audit log creation
tracing::info!(
    event = "audit_log",
    user_id = ?log.user_id,
    data_type = %log.data_type,
    access_type = %log.access_type,
    purpose = %log.purpose
);
```
5. **Regular Audits**: Automated quarterly reviews of access patterns to detect anomalies

### Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing

The p2p data sharing implementation ensures privacy through:

- Granular user consent flows for data sharing
- Research data sharing with anonymization
- Double Ratchet encryption for privacy-preserving health data sharing
- All sensitive health data shared exclusively through p2panda peer channels
