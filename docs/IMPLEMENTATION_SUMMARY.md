# Android Currency Integration Implementation Summary

## Task Overview
Implement the Android currency preference system as specified in the architectural plan, connecting Kotlin UI to shared Rust domain logic via gRPC while maintaining offline capability.

## Implementation Progress

### Completed Analysis
- Reviewed architecture specification in `docs/android_currency_integration.md`
- Analyzed backend implementation in:
  - `packages/domains/finance/src/application/user_preferences.rs`
  - `packages/domains/sheets/src/application/expense_import/import_processor.rs`
- Reviewed database schema in `migrations/20250729000001_add_data_sharing_preferences_table.sql`

### Key Findings
1. UserPreferences trait and service already exist
2. DataSharingPreference model already has preferred_currency field in database model
3. ExpenseImportProcessor already uses user preferences for currency
4. Android directory structure needs to be created
5. Sled and gRPC infrastructure needs to be implemented

# Finance-Sheets Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Finance-Sheets integration for the CPC platform. The integration enables users to leverage spreadsheet functionality for financial analysis, budgeting, and expense tracking while maintaining loose coupling between domains through event-driven architecture.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Financial Formula Functions

Extended the Sheets formula evaluator with comprehensive financial functions:

#### PMT (Payment)
- Calculates loan payments based on constant payments and interest rates
- Syntax: `PMT(rate, nper, pv, [fv], [type])`
- Supports all standard parameters including future value and payment timing

#### FV (Future Value)
- Calculates future value of investments with periodic payments
- Syntax: `FV(rate, nper, pmt, [pv], [type])`
- Handles both beginning and end-of-period payments

#### NPV (Net Present Value)
- Calculates net present value of investment cash flows
- Syntax: `NPV(rate, value1, [value2], ...)`
- Supports multiple cash flow values

#### IRR (Internal Rate of Return)
- Calculates internal rate of return for series of cash flows
- Syntax: `IRR(values, [guess])`
- Uses Newton-Raphson method for calculation

### 2. Budget Template System

Implemented a system for applying budget templates to sheets:

#### Template Types
- Monthly Budget
- Weekly Budget
- Project Budget
- Custom

#### Functionality
- Automatic template identification based on sheet structure
- Creation of finance domain budget objects from sheet data
- Support for different budget periods (monthly, weekly)
- Error handling for malformed templates

### 3. Expense Import System

Created functionality to import expense data from sheets to the Finance domain:

#### Column Mapping
- Configurable mapping of sheet columns to expense fields
- Support for date, amount, category, description, vendor, and account columns
- Flexible column positioning

#### Import Processing
- Data validation and error reporting
- Batch processing of expense records
- Detailed error information for failed imports
- Support for various date formats

### 4. BI Dashboard Integration

Implemented bidirectional data flow between sheets and finance dashboards:

#### Data Flow
- Publish sheet data to dashboards via event bus
- Update sheet cells from dashboard changes
- Real-time synchronization capabilities

#### Event Types
- `DashboardDataRequested` - Request for dashboard data
- `DashboardDataUpdated` - Updated dashboard data
- `DashboardCellUpdated` - Cell updates from dashboard

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- Follows hexagonal architecture principles
- Event-driven communication between domains
- Loose coupling through event bus
- Clear domain boundaries

### Modules Created
1. **Formula Evaluator Extensions**
   - `packages/domains/sheets/src/application/formula_evaluator.rs`

2. **Budget Templates**
   - `packages/domains/sheets/src/application/budget_templates/`

3. **Expense Import**
   - `packages/domains/sheets/src/application/expense_import/`

4. **Finance Events**
   - `packages/domains/finance/src/application/events.rs`

### Documentation
- `docs/finance_integration_design.md` - Architecture and implementation details
- `docs/formula_reference.md` - Detailed financial function documentation

### Tests
- `packages/domains/sheets/src/formula_evaluator_test.rs` - Tests for financial functions
- `packages/domains/sheets/src/budget_templates_test.rs` - Tests for budget templates
- `packages/domains/sheets/src/expense_import_test.rs` - Tests for expense import

## API Endpoints

### New Routes
- `POST /sheets/{id}/import/expenses` - Import expenses from sheet

## Error Handling

### Financial Calculations
- Precise error messages for invalid arguments
- Mathematical error detection (division by zero, etc.)
- Range validation for parameters

### Import Failures
- Detailed row-level error reporting
- Data capture for troubleshooting
- Partial success handling

### Template Application
- Transactional processing
- Rollback on failure
- Validation of template structure

## Mobile Optimization

All features designed with mobile users in mind:
- Responsive layouts

- XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return)
- MIRR (Modified Internal Rate of Return)

### Advanced Features
- Template customization UI
- Real-time dashboard updates
- Enhanced mobile features
- Advanced data validation

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Formula evaluator functions
- Template identification and processing
- Import processor functionality
