# Security Standards for Cooperative Peer Cloud

## Overview

This document outlines the security standards and protocols for the Cooperative Peer Cloud (CPC) platform, with specific focus on financial data handling in the invoicing module.

## General Security Principles

1. **Zero Trust Architecture**: All network communications must be authenticated and encrypted
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls throughout the technology stack
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users and systems should have only the minimum access necessary
4. **Privacy by Design**: Privacy considerations are integrated into every aspect of system design

## Cryptographic Standards

### Hash Functions
- **BLAKE3**: Used for content hashing and integrity verification
- All financial documents must be hashed before transmission and verified after receipt

### Encryption
- **Double Ratchet Algorithm**: Used for end-to-end encryption of all P2P communications
- **Noise Protocol Framework**: For secure key exchange and session establishment
- **X25519**: For key agreement in encryption operations
- **Ed25519**: For digital signatures

### Key Management
- Keys must be generated using cryptographically secure random number generators
- Private keys must be stored in `cpc-net::storage::SecureStorage` with memory zeroization
- Session keys must be rotated according to these thresholds:
  * Message-based rotation: Every 100 messages
  * Time-based rotation: Every 24 hours
- Key rotation must trigger memory zeroization of old keys
- Session initialization must use X25519 key exchange with proper authentication

## Double Ratchet Implementation Standards

### Session Management Requirements
- Each peer must have a dedicated session state
- Session initialization must establish fresh cryptographic state
- Key rotation must be atomic and include proper state transition
- Session state must be protected against memory scraping

### Session Initialization Requirements
- Each invoice exchange must establish a fresh Double Ratchet session
- Session initialization must use Noise Protocol Framework
- Initial key exchange must use X25519
- Session must include proper authentication of both peers

### Key Rotation Thresholds
- Rotation must occur when either threshold is met:
  * Message count threshold: 100 messages per session
  * Time threshold: 24 hours since last rotation
- Rotation process must include:
  * Zeroization of old session keys
  * Generation of fresh DH ratchet chains
  * Secure establishment of new session state

### Secure Key Storage Requirements
- All session keys must be stored using `SecureStorage`
- Keys must never be stored in plaintext memory
- Memory must be zeroized immediately after keys are no longer needed
- Storage must be thread-safe with proper synchronization

## Network Security

### Transport Security
- **QUIC**: Primary transport protocol with built-in encryption
- **TCP with TLS**: Fallback transport protocol
- All P2P communications must use encrypted transports

### NAT Traversal
- **STUN Servers**: Google STUN servers (stun.l.google.com:19302, stun1.l.google.com:19302) used as fallback for NAT traversal
- **TURN Servers**: Should be deployed for relay when direct connections are not possible

### Peer Discovery
- **Kademlia DHT**: For decentralized peer discovery
- All peer communications must be authenticated

## Financial Data Security (Invoicing Module)

### Data Protection
- All invoices and quotes must be encrypted before P2P transmission
- BLAKE3 hash verification must be performed before processing any received financial documents
- Financial data must never be transmitted unencrypted

### Access Control
- Only authorized parties should be able to view or modify invoices
- User consent must be obtained before sharing financial data with other peers
- Audit logs must be maintained for all sharing operations (with user consent)
### Error Handling
- Circuit breaker pattern must be implemented for repeated network failures with these standards:

## Circuit Breaker Implementation Standards

### Required Configuration Parameters
- Failure threshold: Number of failures that will trip the circuit (default: 5)
- Failure window: Time window for counting failures (default: 60 seconds)
- Reset timeout: Time to wait before attempting to close the circuit (default: 120 seconds)

### State Transition Rules
- **Closed → Open**: When failure count reaches threshold within window
- **Open → Half-Open**: After reset timeout period has elapsed
- **Half-Open → Closed**: If operation succeeds
- **Half-Open → Open**: If operation fails

### Error Handling Protocols
- Circuit breaker must return specific error type (`CircuitBreakerOpen`)
- Applications must handle circuit breaker errors gracefully
- Circuit state must be observable for monitoring
- Operations should fail fast when circuit is open

## Memory Security Standards

### Zeroization Requirements
- All sensitive data must be zeroized immediately after use
- Zeroization must occur in `Drop` implementations
- Use `zeroize` crate for guaranteed memory wiping
- Zeroization must happen before memory is released to allocator

### Secure Data Handling Patterns
- Sensitive data must be wrapped in `SecureData` type
- Direct access to raw bytes should be limited
- Sensitive operations should occur in minimal scope
- Memory should be protected from swapping to disk

### Thread Safety Considerations
- Secure storage must use proper synchronization (mutexes)
- Concurrent access to sensitive data must be controlled
- Deadlock prevention must be considered in secure operations
- Performance impact of synchronization must be monitored

## Implementation Requirements


### P2P Invoice Sharing
1. Serialize invoice to CBOR format
2. Generate BLAKE3 hash of serialized data
3. Encrypt payload using Double Ratchet via `cpc-net::crypto::NoiseSession`
4. Send through QUIC transport with proper peer addressing
5. Include hash verification step on receiver side

### Session Management
- Each invoice exchange should establish a fresh Double Ratchet session
- Session keys should be stored in secure storage (`cpc-net::storage::SecureStorage`)
- Implement key rotation according to security standards (every 100 messages or 24 hours)

### Verification Process
- Generate hash before encryption for sender verification
- Include hash in unencrypted header of payload
- Receiver must verify hash after decryption before processing
- Reject any invoices with hash mismatches

## Compliance

### Data Protection Regulations
- GDPR compliance for European users
- CCPA compliance for California users
- Other applicable regional data protection laws

### Financial Regulations
- Compliance with local financial data handling requirements
- Proper audit trails for all financial transactions
- Secure storage of financial records

## Audit and Monitoring

### Logging
- All sharing operations must be logged (with user consent)
- Logs must not contain sensitive financial data
- Log retention policies must be established

### Monitoring
- Real-time monitoring of suspicious activities
- Alerting for potential security incidents
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing

## Incident Response

### Breach Notification
- Immediate notification to affected users in case of data breaches
- Notification to relevant authorities as required by law
- Detailed incident reports and remediation plans

### Recovery Procedures
- Backup and recovery procedures for encrypted financial data
- Key recovery procedures for lost encryption keys
- Business continuity plans for critical financial services

## Future Considerations

### Post-Quantum Cryptography
- Migration path to quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms
- Regular assessment of cryptographic algorithm security

### Hardware Security
- Integration with hardware security modules (HSMs) where available
- Support for secure enclaves on mobile devices
