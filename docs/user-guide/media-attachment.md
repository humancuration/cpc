# Attaching Media to Your Posts

You can bring your posts to life by attaching media like images, videos, and audio clips. This guide will walk you through the process and help you with any issues you might encounter.

## How to Attach Media

1.  **Start a New Post**: Begin by composing a new post as you normally would.
2.  **Attach a File**: Click on the "Attach Media" button, which often looks like a paperclip icon. This will open a file selector.
3.  **Select Your Media**: Choose the image, video, or audio file you want to upload from your device.
4.  **Processing**: Once selected, a preview of your media will appear in the post composer. You will see an indicator showing that the file is being processed. This step is usually quick, but can take longer for large files.
5.  **Post**: After the media has been successfully processed, the indicator will disappear. You can then finish writing your post and click "Post" to publish it with the attached media.

## Supported File Types and Sizes

To ensure a smooth experience, we support the most common media formats.

*   **Images**: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
*   **Videos**: MP4, WebM, QuickTime
*   **Audio**: MP3, WAV, OGG

There is no strict file size limit for uploads. However, please be aware that very large files (e.g., high-resolution videos) will take longer to upload and process. For best results, we recommend optimizing larger files for the web before uploading.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you run into trouble, here are some common solutions:

**Problem: My media upload seems stuck on "processing."**

*   **Solution**: Media processing, especially for videos, can sometimes take a few minutes. Please be patient. If the status doesn't change after a reasonable amount of time, try removing the attachment (usually by clicking an 'X' on the preview) and uploading it again.

**Problem: I see a "processing failed" error message.**

*   **Solution**: This error typically occurs if the file is corrupted or in a format we don't support. Please ensure your file is one of the types listed above. If the format is correct, the file itself might be damaged. Try re-exporting the file from its original source and uploading it again.

**Problem: I can't find the "Attach Media" button.**

*   **Solution**: This feature is available in the latest version of the app. Please make sure your application is up-to-date.
