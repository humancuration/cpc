3. `packages/infra/sync/queue_test.rs` - Tests for sync queue
4. `packages/infra/integration_test.rs` - Integration tests

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Composite Adapter Pattern
- Runtime selection between online/offline implementations
- Fallback logic for offline storage when online operations fail
- Unified interface through UserPreferences trait

### 2. Sync Queue Infrastructure
- Dedicated system for managing offline operations
- Automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored
- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Background worker for processing sync operations

### 3. Factory Pattern
- Clean creation of appropriate implementations based on network status
- Proper dependency injection

### 4. Android Integration
- Proper initialization of sync system with Tokio runtime
- FFI layer for Kotlin integration

## Dependencies Added

### Android Rust Module
- `tokio` with full features
- `bincode` for serialization
- `sled` for database
- `packages.infra` for infrastructure components

### Infra Crate
- `async-trait` for async trait implementations
- `uuid` with v4 and serde features
- `serde` with derive feature
- `bincode` for serialization
- `sled` for database
- `tonic` for gRPC
- `tokio` with full features
- `packages.domains.finance` for domain dependencies

## Testing

Comprehensive unit and integration tests were created for all major components:
- Composite adapter behavior with network transitions
- Sync queue enqueue/process operations
- Conflict resolution during sync
- Network status change handling
- Offline â†’ online transition with pending operations
- Failed sync attempts with retry/backoff

## Architecture Compliance

The implementation follows the hexagonal architecture principles:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Dependency inversion through traits
- Infrastructure separated from domain logic
- Testable components with minimal coupling
