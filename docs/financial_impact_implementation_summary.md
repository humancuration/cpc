## Technical Architecture

### Rust Implementation
All components are implemented in Rust for performance and reliability:
- Type safety with comprehensive error handling
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Concurrency support with async/await
- WebAssembly compilation for frontend components

### Web Frameworks
- **Axum**: Backend web framework for RESTful APIs
- **Yew**: Frontend web framework for reactive UIs
- **wasm-bindgen**: WebAssembly bindings for frontend integration

### Data Management
- In-memory data structures with thread-safe access
- JSON serialization for API communication
- Chrono for time-based metrics
- UUID for unique identification

## Usage Examples

### Tracking Visualization Engagement
```rust
let mut tracker = FinancialImpactTracker::new(DataSharingLevel::Standard);
tracker.track_visualization_engagement(
    "user123",
    "budget_viz_1",
    VisualizationType::Comparative,
    180.0,  // Time spent (seconds)
    25,     // Interaction count
    0.9,    // Quality score
    Some(0.85), // Confidence score
)?;
```

### Collecting Detailed Feedback
```rust
let mut feedback_collector = FeedbackCollector::new(DataSharingLevel::Standard);
feedback_collector.collect_detailed_feedback(
    "user123",
    "budget_viz_1",
    5,  // Rating
    Some("Excellent visualization that made budgeting easy".to_string()),
    true,  // Helpful
    Some(9),  // Impact rating
    Some(8),  // Understanding rating
    Some(8),  // Confidence rating
)?;
```

### Running A/B Tests
```rust
let mut ab_framework = ABTestingFramework::new();
let test_id = ab_framework.create_test(
    "Budget Visualization Color Scheme Test".to_string(),
    "budget_viz_1".to_string(),
    variants,
);
ab_framework.record_participant_interaction(&test_id, "variant_a", true, 180.0)?;
let results = ab_framework.complete_test(&test_id)?;
```
