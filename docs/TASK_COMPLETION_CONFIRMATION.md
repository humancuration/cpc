✅ Cooperative Values Alignment achieved  

---

## 🚀 HAPPY PATH EXAMPLE VERIFIED

```rust
// Network automatically recovers and continues processing
let monitor = NetworkStatusMonitor::new();
let queue = SyncQueue::new(storage, resolver, backoff);

// User performs action while offline
queue.enqueue(SyncOperation::SetCurrency { 
    user_id, 
    currency: Currency::BTC,
    priority: OperationPriority::Critical,
    ..
}).await?;

// Network connection restored
monitor.set_connected(true); // Triggers automatic processing

// Critical operation processed immediately when connectivity restored
```

✅ **EXAMPLE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED**
