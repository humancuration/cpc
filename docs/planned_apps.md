## Architecture Notes

### Modular Approach
- Don't force every feature on every user
- Core set of essential apps (like Notes and Tasks) with optional modules
- Users can "install" or enable other modules based on their needs
- Keeps the interface clean for those who only want basic functionality

### Seamless Integration
- Different parts work together (e.g., link "Vacation" savings goal to "Plan Vacation" task list)
- Unified design language across all modules
- Focus on providing the most essential 80% of functionality in a clean and accessible way

### Example Architecture

Each module is to be a self-contained Rust crate that the main backend application depends on.

Anatomy of a Module Crate

Let's imagine you want to formalize your Invoicing feature into a proper module. You would create a new crate, for example, at apps/invoicing.

This crate would have a structure that mirrors your hexagonal architecture:
Generated code

      
apps/invoicing/
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â”œâ”€â”€ lib.rs          # Main crate entry, exports the module
    â”œâ”€â”€ domain/         # Core business models (Invoice, Customer)
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ models.rs
    â”œâ”€â”€ application/    # Services that orchestrate business logic
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ service.rs
    â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/ # Implementations of ports (e.g., database)
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ repository.rs
    â””â”€â”€ web/            # Adapters for the web layer (Axum/GraphQL)
        â”œâ”€â”€ routes.rs
        â”œâ”€â”€ graphql.rs
        â””â”€â”€ module.rs   # The "wiring" file for this module

        domain: Contains your pure business models (Invoice, InvoiceStatus, etc.). These should have no knowledge of databases or web frameworks. This is the "hexagon."

    application: Contains the InvoiceService, which uses traits (ports) to talk to the outside world (like an InvoiceRepository trait).

    infrastructure: Contains the PgInvoiceRepository that implements the InvoiceRepository trait using sqlx.

    web: This is the key adapter layer. It contains the Axum routes, GraphQL resolvers, and input/output types specific to this module.

2. The "Wiring" File (web/module.rs)

This is the most important part for making your system plug-and-play. Each module crate will expose a struct and a function to hand its components to the main backend.

// In apps/invoicing/src/web/module.rs

use axum::Router;
use crate::web::{graphql::{InvoicingQuery, InvoicingMutation, InvoicingSubscription}, routes::create_invoicing_router};
use crate::application::service::InvoiceService;
use crate::db::DbPool;

// This struct holds all the pieces the backend needs from this module
pub struct InvoicingModule {
    pub router: Router,
    pub query: InvoicingQuery,
    pub mutation: InvoicingMutation,
    pub subscription: InvoicingSubscription,
}

// This function initializes the module and its dependencies
pub fn initialize(db_pool: DbPool) -> InvoicingModule {
    let invoice_service = InvoiceService::new(db_pool.clone());
    
    InvoicingModule {
        router: create_invoicing_router(invoice_service.clone()),
        query: InvoicingQuery::new(invoice_service.clone()),
        mutation: InvoicingMutation::new(invoice_service.clone()),
        subscription: InvoicingSubscription,
    }
}

3. Wiring it All Together in backend/src/main.rs

Your main.rs will become much simpler. Instead of initializing every service itself, it will just call the initialize function from each module it wants to include.

Before (Simplified from your current code):
      
// In backend/src/main.rs (current)

async fn main() {
    // ... setup ...
    let db = init_db().await.unwrap();

    // Initialize individual services
    let social_service = Arc::new(SocialService::new(...));
    let forum_service = Arc::new(ForumService::new(...));
    // ... and so on for every service

    // Build GraphQL schema by adding each service
    let schema = Schema::build(...)
        .data(social_service.clone())
        .data(forum_service.clone())
        // ... and so on
        .finish();

    // Build Axum router by merging each route
    let app = Router::new()
        .nest("/api/social", routes::social::router().with_state(...))
        .nest("/api/forum", routes::forum::router().with_state(...))
        // ... and so on
        .with_state(schema);
    
    // ... run server ...
}

After (Using the modular approach):
      
// In backend/src/main.rs (proposed)
use cpc_invoicing::web::module as invoicing; // Import the module
use cpc_social::web::module as social;     // Example for another module

async fn main() {
    // ... setup ...
    let db = init_db().await.unwrap();

    // Initialize modules
    let invoicing_module = invoicing::initialize(db.clone());
    let social_module = social::initialize(db.clone());
    // ... initialize other modules as needed

    // Build GraphQL schema by merging module components
    let schema = Schema::build(
        RootQuery(invoicing_module.query, social_module.query),
        RootMutation(invoicing_module.mutation, social_module.mutation),
        RootSubscription(invoicing_module.subscription, social_module.subscription)
    )
    .data(db.clone()) // Add shared state like the DB pool
    .finish();

    // Build Axum router by merging module routers
    let app = Router::new()
        .nest("/api/invoicing", invoicing_module.router)
        .nest("/api/social", social_module.router)
        // ... and so on
        .with_state(schema);
        
    // ... run server ...
}

Adding a new "app" to your multi-use app would then be as simple as:

    Adding the new module crate to your workspace.

    Adding it as a dependency in backend/Cargo.toml.

    Calling its initialize() function in main.rs and adding its components to the Router and Schema.

Step-by-Step Refactoring Plan

    Choose One Feature to Start: Let's use Invoicing as the example.

    Create the New Crate: In your workspace, create the apps/invoicing crate.

    Update Cargo.toml:

        In apps/invoicing/Cargo.toml, add dependencies like axum, async-graphql, sqlx, cpc-core, etc.

        In apps/backend/Cargo.toml, add the new invoicing crate as a dependency: cpc-invoicing = { path = "../invoicing" }.

    Move the Code:

        Move the contents of apps/backend/src/invoicing/ to apps/invoicing/src/.

        Organize the files into the domain, application, infrastructure, and web directories as described above.

        Move the relevant routes from apps/backend/src/routes/ and GraphQL definitions from apps/backend/src/graphql/ into the new crate's web directory.

    Create the module.rs: Implement the initialize() function in apps/invoicing/src/web/module.rs to wire up and return the module's router and GraphQL components.

    Update backend/main.rs: Modify your main.rs to import and use the invoicing module as shown in the "After" example. You will remove the direct initialization of InvoiceService and its routes from main.rs.

    Repeat: Repeat this process for your other vertical slices (social, forum, governance, etc.).

    This approach provides very clear boundaries, allows modules to be developed and tested more independently, and makes your main backend crate a lightweight "aggregator" of modules, which is exactly what you want for a plug-and-play system.
