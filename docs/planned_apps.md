Each module is to be a self-contained Rust crate that the main backend application depends on, and users can install/uninstall them from the options menu (in an app options submenu).

# Apps Checklist

Each app module is to be a self-contained Rust crate that the main backend application depends on. Feel free to add to this list of apps with others that you think would be a good idea! (Always check to see the progress of the app before making further plans for it)

We should implement oauth2 with support for TikTok, Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, WeChat, Messenger, Snapchat, Discord, X, Twitch, Gmail, etc.

Leave blank if not started, mark [/] if partially implemented, [x] if implemented more fully, and [z] if it is difficult to find ways for improvement. Aim to start all apps to at least an x, then when that is done, we do a second pass and aim to upgrade everything to the Z tier of features.

- Prioritize accessibility and mobile-first design
- Include comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, UI)
- Support internationalization from initial development

## Architecture Notes

### Modular Approach

- Users can "install" or enable other apps based on their needs
- Keeps the interface clean for those who only want basic functionality

### Seamless Integration
- Different parts work together (e.g., link "Vacation" savings goal to "Plan Vacation" task list)
- Unified design language across all modules
- Focus on providing the most essential functionality in a clean and accessible way, then build upon the core features with improvements later.


### Core Design Philosophy

* **True Modularity**: Each app module must function as a standalone, self-contained unit that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
* **User Empowerment**: Users should be able to enable/disable modules at runtime without restarting the application (optional, if this is impossible)
* **Cooperative Values**: Architecture must support transparency, user control, and community participation in feature development
