Schema Guardrails (GraphQL) — Micro-retro

- What worked: non-blocking guardrails surfaced drift early without blocking merges
- What worked: PR template nudge kept authors explicit about intentional changes
- What worked: single-source docs (rollout, dev snippet, playbook, QA) reduced confusion
- What was tricky: naming consistency (job/docs references); standardized on “schema_guardrails”
- What was tricky: discoverability until we added central links
- We’ll reuse: triage playbook pattern for quick actions and ownership
- We’ll reuse: QA checklist format for lightweight checks
- We’ll reuse: rollout summary + maintainer tips and links
- Next time: announce in README earlier to boost visibility
- Next time: add tracking issue template sooner for follow-ups
- Tracking issue template: .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/tracking.md
