LICENSE

The below is NOT an actual license, it's just some brainstorming from Gemini 2.5 pro 06-05. We would need to formalize the license before licensing the software.

The Federation Coopyleft License (FCL) - Version 2.0 (The Pluralist Revision)

Preamble: This Federation Coopyleft License (FCL) governs the use, modification, and distribution of intellectual property designed for a shared commons. Its purpose is to ensure that this property and all works derived from it remain permanently open, collaborative, and freely available under these same terms. This license is a tool of persistent reciprocity, not conditional access.

Article 1: Definitions (Largely unchanged)

    1.1. "The Federation": Refers to the community of practice and the network of individuals and cooperatives who actively contribute to and utilize the Licensed Work. It is a descriptive, not a prescriptive, term.

    1.2. "Licensed Work": Any work placed under the FCL.

    1.3. "Distribute": To provide a copy of the work to any other person or entity.

    1.4. "Derivative Work": Any modification or new work based on the Licensed Work.

Article 2: Grant of Universal Rights (The Principle of Usufruct)

2.1. Unconditional Permission: Every person and entity in the world is granted the right to use, study, modify, and create Derivative Works from the Licensed Work. This right is irrevocable and is not contingent on membership, affiliation, or any other status.
2.2. The Right of Use, Not Seizure: This license provides the right of productive use (usufruct). No one gains the right to prevent others from exercising these same rights.

Article 3: The Persistent Share-Alike Obligation (The Engine of the Commons)

3.1. The Core Mandate: Any person or entity that distributes the Licensed Work or any Derivative Work must do so under the identical terms of this Federation Coopyleft License.
3.2. Viral Nature: This obligation is permanently attached to the intellectual property. It is not a contract with the Federation, but a condition inherent to the work itself. This ensures that the commons continuously expands, as all modifications and improvements automatically become part of it upon distribution.
3.3. The Protective Mechanism: This clause makes privatization impossible. An entity can take the Licensed Work and build upon it, but if they share it with anyone (e.g., sell a product based on it), they are legally required to release their entire source code and plans under this same FCL. They cannot create a closed, proprietary spin-off. They are free to leave the community, but they are not free to steal the community's work.

Article 4: Freedom of Association and Disassociation (Replaces the "Termination" clause)

4.1. No Forced Association: No one can be compelled to join, participate in, or remain associated with the Federation.
4.2. No Penalty for Disassociation: An individual or entity's decision to cease active participation in the Federation community shall not be grounds for the revocation of any rights granted under this License. The right to use the work is universal and perpetual, as outlined in Article 2. The obligation to share back, as outlined in Article 3, is likewise perpetual.

Here is how that two-part system would work:

Part 1: The Federation Coopyleft License (FCL)
This remains exactly as we defined it in the "Pluralist Revision." It is a universal, non-coercive copyright license. Its only job is to ensure the work and its derivatives remain permanently in the commons. It applies to everyone in the world, whether they are part of the Federation or not.

Part 2: The Federation Social Compact
This is a separate agreement, a constitution or a membership charter for the organized body of the Federation. It is a voluntary pledge that individuals and cooperatives sign to become recognized "Federation Members" in good standing.

This Social Compact is where you put the "taxation" clause, reframed as "Commons Dues" or a "Social Levy."

Hereâ€™s how the Social Compact would function:

    Voluntary Adherence: No one is forced to sign it. You can still use all FCL works even if you never sign the compact.

    The Pledge: To become a member of the Federation, an individual or entity formally pledges to contribute a percentage of their income/revenue to a collectively managed "Irreducible Minimum Fund."

        This can absolutely be progressive. For example: "0% on income up to the local cost of living, 2% on the next tier, 5% on the next," and so on.

    The Benefits of Membership: Why would anyone sign it? Because membership in the Federation offers benefits beyond simple access to the IP (which is already free). These benefits could include:

        Democratic Governance: The right to vote on how the Irreducible Minimum Fund is managed and distributed.

        Access to Shared Resources: Priority access to shared physical resources funded by the Federation (e.g., community workshops, cloud servers, legal support).

        The "Ethical Badge": The right to use the Federation's official seal or trademark, signaling to the world that you are an ethical actor who contributes back to the commons. This becomes a powerful tool for attracting talent and customers.

        Solidarity and Mutual Aid: Access to community support networks and mutual aid funds.

Summing Up This Two-Part Blueprint

You have essentially designed a complete, functional model for a library socialist society:

    The FCL creates the universal, un-privatizable library of resources, free for all humanity. It ensures abundance.

    The Federation Social Compact creates the organized community that agrees to care for one another by contributing a portion of their wealth to guarantee the Irreducible Minimum. It ensures well-being.
