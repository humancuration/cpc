# Universal Income Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the Universal Income system for the CPC platform, which distributes dabloons as a daily income to all federation members.

## Overview

The implementation adds a Universal Income system to the finance module, allowing all federation members to receive a daily allocation of dabloons. The system is designed to work in a p2p environment with secure communication and data sharing.

EVERYONE EARNS THE SAME UNIVERSAL INCOME.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Domain Layer

#### Rewards Module
- Added `UniversalIncomeConfig` struct for configuring the daily income amount and program status
- Added `UIDistribution` struct for tracking income distributions to users
- Added `UIService` trait for Universal Income operations

### 2. Application Layer

#### Rewards Service
- Added `UIConfigRepository` trait for Universal Income configuration persistence
- Added `UIDistributionRepository` trait for Universal Income distribution records
- Added `RewardsWalletService` trait for wallet operations needed by the rewards system
- Implemented `UIServiceImpl` for managing Universal Income distribution
- Added methods for calculating daily amounts, checking if a user has received income, and distributing income

### 3. Infrastructure Layer

#### Database Schema
- Created migration `20250728000014_create_ui_tables.sql`
- Added `ui_config` table for Universal Income configuration
- Added `ui_distributions` table for tracking income distributions
- Added indexes for better query performance

#### Database Models
- Added `UIConfigDbModel` for Universal Income configuration
- Added `UIDistributionDbModel` for income distribution records
- Added conversion methods to handle data between domain and database models

#### Database Repositories
- Added `PostgresUIConfigRepository` for Universal Income configuration persistence
- Added `PostgresUIDistributionRepository` for income distribution records

#### p2p Infrastructure
- Added `rewards_sharing.rs` for secure p2p communication with Double Ratchet encryption
- Added methods for sharing UI configuration, distribution records, and requesting distributions

### 4. Integration with Wallet Service

#### Wallet Service
- Added `distribute_universal_income` method to `WalletService` trait
- Implemented `distribute_universal_income` method in `WalletServiceImpl`
- Updated `RewardsWalletService` trait to include the new method
- Updated mock implementation in tests

## Architecture Considerations

### Hexagonal Architecture
- Maintained clean separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- Used repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Preserved dependency inversion principle

### Screaming Architecture
- All new code clearly expresses its purpose through naming and structure
- Domain models and services are organized by business capability

### Vertical Slices
- Implementation organized in logical chunks that each provide value
- Each feature area (domain, application, infrastructure) implemented cohesively

## Federation Integration

### Data Sharing
- Extended data sharing preferences to include UI configuration controls
- Implemented secure p2p communication with Double Ratchet encryption
- Added methods for sharing UI configuration, distribution records, and requesting distributions

## Security Considerations

### Secure Communication
- Implemented Double Ratchet encryption for p2p communication
- Added user consent verification for data sharing
- Used secure serialization and deserialization of data

## Backward Compatibility

### Database Migrations
- New tables with default values
- Automatic conversion of existing data (not applicable for new tables)
- Preserved all existing data and functionality

### API Compatibility
- Extended existing APIs with new methods
- Preserved all existing functionality
- No breaking changes to existing interfaces

## Future Expansion Points

### Dynamic Income Calculation
- Implement varying income amounts based on user status, participation, etc.
- Add community contribution factors to income calculation

### Advanced Analytics
- Cross-user income distribution analysis (with consent)
- Federation-wide Universal Income metrics

### Integration with Other Systems
- Connect Universal Income with budgeting and savings goals
- Implement automatic spending tracking for income

## Implementation Status

âœ… Phase 1 (Minimum Viable Universal Income) - COMPLETED
- Domain models for Universal Income configuration and distribution
- Application service for managing Universal Income distribution
- Database schema and repositories for persistence
- p2p integration for secure communication
- Wallet service integration for income distribution
- Comprehensive test coverage
