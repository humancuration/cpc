# Wallet Integration Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the wallet integration for the CPC platform, connecting Dabloons with existing budgeting and savings functionality.

## Overview

The implementation adds dual-currency support to the finance module, allowing users to create budgets and savings goals that combine traditional currencies (USD, EUR, etc.) with Dabloons. It also enables wallet-to-budget integration for automatic spending tracking.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Dual-Currency Domain Models

#### Budget Module
- Added `BudgetAllocation` struct for dual-currency allocations
- Updated `Budget` struct with separate primary currency and Dabloons fields
- Added `BudgetCurrencyType` enum (TraditionalOnly, DabloonsOnly, Mixed)
- Implemented methods for mixed-currency budget creation and management
- Added `update_spent_with_dabloons()` method for tracking Dabloons spending

#### Savings Goals Module
- Added `DualCurrencyTarget` struct for dual-currency targets
- Updated `SavingsGoal` struct with separate primary currency and Dabloons fields
- Added `SavingsCurrencyType` enum (TraditionalOnly, DabloonsOnly, Mixed)
- Implemented methods for mixed-currency goal creation and management
- Added `add_contribution()` method for adding contributions in either currency

### 2. Service Layer Integration

#### Wallet Service
- Added `link_to_budget()` method to connect wallet spending to budget categories
- Added `get_linked_budgets()` method to retrieve budgets linked to a wallet
- Updated error handling to use unified `FinanceError` types

#### Budget Service
- Added `create_mixed_budget()` method for creating dual-currency budgets
- Added `update_spent_with_dabloons()` method for tracking Dabloons spending
- Updated error handling to use unified `FinanceError` types

#### Savings Service
- Added `create_mixed_goal()` method for creating dual-currency savings goals
- Added `add_contribution()` method for adding contributions in either currency
- Updated error handling to use unified `FinanceError` types

### 3. Database Schema Updates

#### Migration File
- Created migration `20250728000013_add_dabloons_fields_to_budgets_and_savings_goals.sql`
- Added `dabloons_allocated` and `dabloons_spent` columns to `budgets` table
- Added `target_dabloons` and `current_dabloons` columns to `savings_goals` table
- Added `currency_type` column to both tables with default value "TraditionalOnly"
- Added indexes for better query performance

#### Database Models
- Updated `BudgetDbModel` with new Dabloons fields
- Updated `SavingsGoalDbModel` with new Dabloons fields
- Updated conversion methods to handle dual-currency data

#### Database Repositories
- Updated SQL queries in `PostgresBudgetRepository` to include new fields
- Updated SQL queries in `PostgresSavingsRepository` to include new fields

### 4. Error Handling

#### New Error Types
- `InsufficientFunds(Currency)` - Insufficient funds in specified currency
- `BudgetExceeded { category: String }` - Budget exceeded for a category
- `InvalidCurrency` - Invalid currency type

#### Error Conversion
- Updated error conversion from wallet errors to unified `FinanceError`

### 5. Visualization

#### Bevy Financial Visualization
- Added `build_dual_currency_budget_chart()` function for dual-currency budget visualization
- Updated `build_savings_progress_ring()` to show both currency progress rings
- Updated `build_wallet_coin_visualization()` to use "Dabloon yellow" color

### 6. Testing

#### New Test Files
- Created `budget_test.rs` with comprehensive tests for dual-currency budgets
- Created `savings_goal_test.rs` with comprehensive tests for dual-currency savings goals
- Created `wallet_budget_test.rs` with tests for wallet-budget integration

#### Updated Test Modules
- Updated `lib.rs` to include new test modules

## Architecture Considerations

### Hexagonal Architecture
- Maintained clean separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers
- Used repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Preserved dependency inversion principle

### Screaming Architecture
- All new code clearly expresses its purpose through naming and structure
- Domain models and services are organized by business capability

### Vertical Slices
- Implementation organized in logical chunks that each provide value
- Each feature area (budgets, savings, wallet integration) implemented cohesively

## Federation Integration

### Data Sharing
- Extended data sharing preferences to include currency-specific controls
- Implemented automatic anonymization for small transaction amounts
- Added federation-wide opt-out registry support

## Security Considerations

### Transaction Safety
- Implemented database-level pessimistic locking for wallet transfers
- Added transaction IDs to prevent replay attacks
- Implemented blockchain-style transaction chaining

### Double-Spending Prevention
- Added lightweight Merkle tree for transaction verification
- Implemented signature validation for all wallet transactions between nodes

## Backward Compatibility

### Database Migrations
- New columns for Dabloons with default 0 values
- Automatic conversion of existing budgets to "TraditionalOnly" type
- Preserved all existing data and functionality

### API Compatibility
- Extended existing APIs with new dual-currency methods
- Preserved all existing single-currency functionality
- No breaking changes to existing interfaces

## Future Expansion Points

### Marketplace Integration
- Convert Dabloons to traditional currency via cooperative labor
- Implement escrow service for Dabloons transactions

### Social Gifting
- Send Dabloons as gifts with custom messages
- Track gift impact on recipient's budget/savings

### Advanced Analytics
- Cross-user spending pattern analysis (with consent)
- Cooperative-wide Dabloons circulation metrics

## Implementation Status

âœ… Phase 1 (Minimum Viable Integration) - COMPLETED
- Budget module integration with dual-currency support
- Wallet-budget connection with automatic deduction
- Basic visualization for dual-currency budgets
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Database migration with backward compatibility
