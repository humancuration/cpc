- `packages/cpc-core/invoicing/src/infrastructure/payment/paypal.rs` - PayPal payment processor implementation
- `packages/cpc-core/invoicing/src/infrastructure/encryption/key_manager.rs` - Secure API key management using cpc-net encryption

#### Application Services
- Enhanced `packages/cpc-core/invoicing/src/application/invoice_service.rs` with payment processing capabilities

### 2. Automatic Payment Reminders (Milestone 2)

#### Domain Models
- `packages/cpc-core/invoicing/src/domain/reminder.rs` - Payment reminder configuration and instances

#### Application Services
- `packages/cpc-core/invoicing/src/application/reminder_service.rs` - Reminder scheduling and processing service

#### Infrastructure
- `packages/cpc-core/invoicing/src/infrastructure/notification/mod.rs` - Notification module
- `packages/cpc-core/invoicing/src/infrastructure/notification/email.rs` - Email notification implementation
- `packages/cpc-core/invoicing/src/infrastructure/notification/sms.rs` - SMS notification implementation
- `packages/cpc-core/invoicing/src/infrastructure/notification/p2p.rs` - P2P notification implementation
- `packages/cpc-core/invoicing/src/infrastructure/scheduler/mod.rs` - Scheduler module
- `packages/cpc-core/invoicing/src/infrastructure/scheduler/reminder_scheduler.rs` - Reminder scheduling infrastructure

#### Presentation
- `packages/cpc-core/invoicing/src/presentation/yew/reminder_config_ui.rs` - Yew UI for reminder configuration

### 3. Status Tracking Workflow (Milestone 3)

#### Domain Models
- `packages/cpc-core/invoicing/src/domain/status.rs` - Enhanced PaymentStatus with new states and workflow configuration

#### Application Services
- `packages/cpc-core/invoicing/src/application/workflow_engine.rs` - Workflow engine for status transitions

#### Infrastructure
- `packages/cpc-core/invoicing/src/infrastructure/audit/payment_audit_logger.rs` - Audit logging for payment status changes

#### Presentation
- `packages/cpc-core/invoicing/src/presentation/bevy/payment_status_viz.rs` - Bevy visualizations for payment status flow

## Security and Compliance

### PCI DSS Compliance
- Secure storage of payment processor API keys using encryption
- Isolation of payment processing components
- Audit logging of all payment-related activities

### Data Encryption
- Implementation of secure key management using cpc-net encryption
- Protection of sensitive payment data at rest and in transit

## P2P Synchronization

- All financial and CRM data uses Double Ratchet encryption
- Implementation of p2panda schema definitions for data sharing
- Synchronization of payment status changes across the network

## Integration Points

### Calendar Module
- Synchronization of invoice due dates with calendar events
- Timeline views for payment deadlines

### CRM Module
- Linking of invoices to customer records
- Integration with sales reporting

### Health Module
- No direct integration in this implementation

## Testing Strategy

### Property-Based Tests
- Domain model validation for payment statuses and transitions
- Reminder configuration validation

### Integration Tests
- P2P synchronization testing
- Payment processor integration testing

### Visual Regression Tests
- Bevy component rendering verification

## Documentation

### API Documentation
- Updated documentation in `docs/api/`

### Inline Documentation
- Comprehensive documentation for all public interfaces

### User Guides
- User guides in `docs/user_guides/`

## Cooperative Values Implementation

### Transparency
- Clear audit trails for all financial operations
- User-configurable reminder settings

### Data Ownership
- Users own their financial data
- Easy export of all invoice data in standard formats

### No Vendor Lock-in
- Support for multiple payment processors
- Standard interfaces for payment service providers
