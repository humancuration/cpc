# Learning Core Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the Learning Core crate for the CPC Learning Platform.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Domain Layer
- **Course**: Course entity with modules and lessons
- **Enrollment**: User enrollment tracking with progress and status
- **AcademicCredential**: Credential issuance with verification codes
- **Tip**: Tipping functionality with course association

### 2. Application Layer
- **LearningPlatformService**: Main service coordinating business logic
- Error handling with LearningPlatformError enum
- Repository traits for dependency inversion

### 3. Infrastructure Layer
- **Repositories**: PostgreSQL implementations for all entities
- **gRPC Service**: Implementation of the LearningPlatformService gRPC interface
- **gRPC Server**: Server setup with dependency injection

### 4. Database
- Migration script for all required tables
- Migration binary for database setup
- Indexes for performance optimization

### 5. Testing
- Unit tests for domain models
- Unit tests for application service
- Integration tests with PostgreSQL

### 6. Documentation
- README with project overview
- Usage guide with examples
- Inline code documentation

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Course Management**
   - Create courses with title, description, and creator
   - Support for modules and lessons (partial implementation)

2. **Enrollment Tracking**
   - User enrollment in courses
   - Progress tracking with status updates
   - Completion detection

3. **Credential Issuance**
   - Academic credential generation
   - Verification code system
   - Prerequisite validation (course completion)

4. **Tipping System**
   - Educator tipping with course association
   - Amount and currency tracking
   - Validation for positive amounts

5. **gRPC API**
   - Full implementation of all service methods
   - Proper error handling and conversion
   - Client and server generation

6. **Database Integration**
   - PostgreSQL repository implementations
   - Connection pooling
   - Migration support

## Architecture Highlights

- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Clear separation of domain, application, and infrastructure
- **Dependency Inversion**: Repository traits for testability
- **Vertical Slicing**: Feature-focused organization
- **Async/Await**: Non-blocking operations throughout
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing with UUIDs and enums

## Usage Examples

The crate includes two examples:
1. `client.rs`: gRPC client usage
2. `direct_usage.rs`: Direct service usage without gRPC

## Testing

- Unit tests for all domain models
- Unit tests for application service with mock repositories
- Integration tests with a real PostgreSQL database

## Deployment

- gRPC server binary for standalone deployment
- Migration binary for database setup
- Environment variable configuration

## Future Improvements

1. Full implementation of modules and lessons in courses
2. Additional repository implementations (e.g., in-memory for testing)
3. More comprehensive integration tests
4. Performance optimizations
5. Additional validation and business rules
