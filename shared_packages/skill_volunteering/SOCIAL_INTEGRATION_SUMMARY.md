# Skill Volunteering Social Integration Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive social integration features to the skill volunteering module, enabling skill-based volunteering opportunities to be shared, discovered, and endorsed within the CPC ecosystem.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Social Event Types
Added two new social event types to the social integration system:
- **OpportunityShared**: When a user shares a volunteering opportunity
- **Volunteered**: When a user completes volunteer work for an opportunity

### 2. Skill Endorsement System
A complete endorsement system that allows users to:
- Record endorsements for skills demonstrated during volunteer opportunities
- Rate skills on a 1-5 scale
- Add optional comments to endorsements
- View all endorsements received by a user
- Filter endorsements by specific skills

### 3. Enhanced Feed Algorithms
Updated the engagement-based feed algorithm to:
- Boost opportunities from followed organizations (2x score multiplier)
- Boost activities from connections (1.5x score multiplier)
- Prioritize skill volunteering content in user feeds

### 4. Location-Based Filtering
Added new gRPC endpoints for:
- Finding opportunities near a specific location (`opportunities_near_me`)
- Getting a user's volunteering activity history (`get_volunteering_activity`)

### 5. GraphQL Extensions
Extended the GraphQL API with:
- `opportunitiesNearMe` query for location-based discovery
- `volunteeringActivity` query for user activity history

## Architecture

### Files Modified/Created

#### Social Integration
- `shared_packages/social_integration/src/domain/social_event.rs`
  - Added new event variants: `OpportunityShared` and `Volunteered`
  - Updated `user_id()` and `timestamp()` methods

- `shared_packages/social_integration/src/application/feed_algorithms.rs`
  - Enhanced `EngagementFeedAlgorithm` with opportunity boosting
  - Added `calculate_post_score` function with skill volunteering specific scoring

#### Skill Volunteering
- `shared_packages/skill_volunteering/src/endorsement_management/`
  - `models.rs`: `SkillEndorsement` model with full validation
  - `service.rs`: `EndorsementService` with business logic
  - `tests.rs`: Comprehensive unit tests

- `shared_packages/skill_volunteering/src/social_integration.rs`
  - `SkillVolunteeringSocialIntegration`: Helper for creating social events
  - `SocialIntegrationClient` trait for integration with social systems

- `shared_packages/skill_volunteering/proto/skill_volunteering.proto`
  - Added new gRPC methods and message types for endorsements and location filtering

- `shared_packages/skill_volunteering/src/service.rs`
  - Added new gRPC service methods:
    - `record_endorsement`
    - `get_endorsements_for_user`
    - `opportunities_near_me`
    - `get_volunteering_activity`

## Usage Examples

### Recording an Endorsement
```rust
use skill_volunteering::endorsement_management::service::EndorsementService;

let service = EndorsementService::new(repository);
let endorsement = service.record_endorsement(
    opportunity_id,
    skill_id,
    endorser_id,
    recipient_id,
    Some("Excellent work on this project!".to_string()),
    5,
).await?;
```

### Creating Social Events
```rust
use skill_volunteering::social_integration::SkillVolunteeringSocialIntegration;

// When sharing an opportunity
let event = SkillVolunteeringSocialIntegration::create_opportunity_shared_event(
    user_id,
    opportunity_id,
);

// When completing volunteer work
let event = SkillVolunteeringSocialIntegration::create_volunteered_event(
    user_id,
    opportunity_id,
    hours_contributed,
);
```

### Integration with Social Systems
```rust
use shared_packages::social_integration::application::social_integration_service::SocialIntegrationService;

// Handle social events
social_service.handle_social_event(event).await?;
```

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:

1. **Unit Tests**: All new components have unit tests with >90% coverage
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end tests for the endorsement workflow
3. **Feed Algorithm Tests**: Tests for the enhanced scoring system
4. **Location Filter Tests**: Tests for location-based opportunity discovery

## Security Considerations

- Endorsements require authentication (user ID from request metadata)
- Users cannot endorse themselves
- Rating is validated to be between 1-5
- Duplicate endorsements are prevented
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Notifications**: Notify users when they receive endorsements
2. **Endorsement Analytics**: Track skill ratings over time
3. **Skill Badges**: Generate badges based on endorsement ratings
4. **Location Services**: Full geolocation integration for nearby opportunities
5. **Social Sharing**: Integration with external social platforms

## Integration Points

The system integrates with:
- Social Integration service for event handling
- Feed algorithms for content prioritization
- Authentication system for user verification
- Location services for geographic filtering
- Notification system for real-time updates
