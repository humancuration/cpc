# Social Graph Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the social_graph package for the CPC ecosystem.

## Overview

The social_graph package provides functionality for managing social relationships and interactions within the CPC ecosystem. It follows hexagonal architecture principles with clear separation of concerns between domain, application, infrastructure, and presentation layers.

## Implementation Status

✅ **Completed** - All required files and features have been implemented according to the specification.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Domain Layer
- **User Model**: Represents users in the social graph with ID, username, display name, email, and timestamps
- **Relationship Model**: Represents connections between users with support for Friend, Follower, Blocked, and Pending relationship types
- **Activity Model**: Represents user activities with various activity types and metadata support
- **Repository Trait**: Defined RelationshipRepository trait for data access abstraction

### 2. Application Layer
- **Social Service**: Coordinates between repositories and consent management
- **Business Logic**: Implements friendship creation with consent validation
- **Service Integration**: Combines domain models with infrastructure components

### 3. Infrastructure Layer
- **Consent Adapter**: Integrates with consent_manager crate for consent management
- **In-Memory Repository**: Implementation for testing and development
- **PostgreSQL Repository**: Production-ready implementation with full CRUD operations
- **Database Migrations**: SQL scripts for creating social graph tables

### 4. Presentation Layer
- **GraphQL Schema**: Complete GraphQL API with queries for social interactions
- **Type Mapping**: Proper conversion between domain models and GraphQL types
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of the GraphQL interface

## Required Files Implementation

All required files from the task have been implemented:

1. ✅ `shared_packages/social_graph/src/domain/model/user.rs` - User entity with creation and management
2. ✅ `shared_packages/social_graph/src/domain/model/relationship.rs` - Relationship entity with multiple types
3. ✅ `shared_packages/social_graph/src/domain/model/activity.rs` - Activity entity with various types
4. ✅ `shared_packages/social_graph/src/domain/repository/relationship_repo.rs` - Repository trait definition
5. ✅ `shared_packages/social_graph/src/infrastructure/consent_adapter/mod.rs` - Consent integration with consent_manager
6. ✅ `shared_packages/social_graph/src/presentation/graphql/schema.rs` - GraphQL API implementation
7. ✅ `shared_packages/social_graph/src/lib.rs` - Main library with module declarations
8. ✅ `shared_packages/social_graph/Cargo.toml` - Package configuration with dependencies

## GraphQL API

The package provides a complete GraphQL API with the following queries:
- `getFriends(user_id)`: Get friends of a user
- `getActivityFeed(user_id)`: Get activity feed for a user
- `getRecommendations(user_id)`: Get recommended users

## Repository Implementations

Two repository implementations are provided:
1. **In-Memory Repository**: For testing and development
2. **PostgreSQL Repository**: For production use with full database integration

## Consent Integration

The package integrates with the consent_manager crate to ensure all social interactions respect user consent preferences. The ConsentAdapter provides a clean interface for checking and updating consent levels.

## Testing and Quality

- Unit tests for all domain models
- Integration tests for repositories
- Performance benchmarks
- Example applications demonstrating usage
- Comprehensive documentation

## Documentation

- README with overview and usage instructions
- Detailed usage guide
- GraphQL API documentation
- File structure summary
- Implementation summary (this document)
- Database migration scripts

## Dependencies

The package uses industry-standard dependencies:
- `async-graphql` for GraphQL implementation
- `async-trait` for async trait support
- `serde` for serialization
- `uuid` for unique identifiers
- `chrono` for date/time handling
- `tokio` for async runtime
- `sqlx` for database access
- `consent_manager` for consent integration

## Architecture Compliance

The implementation follows all specified architectural principles:
- Hexagonal architecture with clear layer separation
- Rust 2021 edition compliance
- Tauri 2.0 compatible dependencies
- Integration with consent_manager via the crate (not gRPC as initially mentioned)
- Comprehensive GraphQL schema implementation

## Integration with Existing CPC Ecosystem

The package integrates well with existing CPC packages:
- Uses consent_manager for consent management
- Follows similar patterns to social_interactions and social_enhancements
- Compatible with the overall CPC architecture
- Ready for use in Tauri 2.0 applications

## Conclusion

The social_graph package has been successfully implemented with all required features and follows best practices for Rust development and hexagonal architecture. It provides a solid foundation for social features within the CPC ecosystem and is ready for integration into applications.
