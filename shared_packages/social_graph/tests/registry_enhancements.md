# Content Provider Registry Test Enhancements

## Dependency Conflict Tests
- Test missing dependency during registration
- Test version mismatch in provider dependencies
- Test circular dependency detection
- Test dependency resolution with multiple levels
- Test version range compatibility checks

## State Migration Failure Tests
```rust
// Test serialization failure during update
// Should preserve original provider state
fn test_serialization_failure() {
    // Setup provider with failing serialize_state()
    // Attempt update
    // Verify original provider still functional
}

// Test deserialization failure during update
// Should rollback to previous provider version
fn test_deserialization_failure() {
    // Setup state that new provider can't deserialize
    // Attempt update
    // Verify rollback occurred
}
```

## Rollback Mechanism Tests
| Test Case | Expected Outcome |
|-----------|------------------|
| Migration timeout | Restore previous provider |
| Schema incompatibility | Preserve original state |
| Partial migration failure | Full state restoration |
| Concurrent access during migration | Transaction isolation |

## Test Implementation Notes
- Use mock providers with controllable failure points
- Verify registry consistency after failed operations
- Test edge cases like high-concurrency updates
- Validate dependency graph integrity checks
