# ErrorBoundary Component Integration Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the integration test plan for the ErrorBoundary component in the web_core package. These tests will verify that the ErrorBoundary component works correctly with various child components, nested ErrorBoundary components, and integrates properly with the theme system.

## Component Analysis

The ErrorBoundary component has the following key features that need integration testing:
- Error catching functionality for child components
- Nested ErrorBoundary support
- Theme system integration
- Fallback UI rendering
- Error callback execution
- Reset functionality

## Testing Approach

The integration tests will focus on:
1. Testing ErrorBoundary with various child components that might throw errors
2. Testing nested ErrorBoundary components to ensure proper error propagation
3. Testing integration with the theme system for consistent styling

## Test Cases

### 1. Integration Tests with Various Child Components

#### 1.1 Testing with Simple Child Components
```rust
#[wasm_bindgen_test]
fn test_error_boundary_with_simple_child_components() {
    // Test that ErrorBoundary correctly renders child components when no errors occur
    // This would require a DOM testing utility to verify the actual HTML output
}
```

#### 1.2 Testing with Components That Throw Errors
```rust
#[wasm_bindgen_test]
fn test_error_boundary_with_error_throwing_components() {
    // Test that ErrorBoundary catches errors from child components and displays fallback UI
    // This would require creating a test component that throws an error
}
```

#### 1.3 Testing with Components That Throw Different Types of Errors
```rust
#[wasm_bindgen_test]
fn test_error_boundary_with_various_error_types() {
    // Test that ErrorBoundary handles different types of errors from child components
    // (e.g., JavaScript errors, Rust panics, etc.)
}
```

### 2. Integration Tests for Nested ErrorBoundary Components

#### 2.1 Testing Nested ErrorBoundaries with Independent Error Handling
```rust
#[wasm_bindgen_test]
fn test_nested_error_boundaries_independent_errors() {
    // Test that nested ErrorBoundary components handle errors independently
    // Each ErrorBoundary should catch errors from its direct children only
}
```

#### 2.2 Testing Nested ErrorBoundaries with Propagated Errors
```rust
#[wasm_bindgen_test]
fn test_nested_error_boundaries_propagated_errors() {
    // Test that errors propagate correctly through nested ErrorBoundary components
    // when inner ErrorBoundaries don't handle the error
}
```

#### 2.3 Testing Nested ErrorBoundaries with Mixed Error Scenarios
```rust
#[wasm_bindgen_test]
fn test_nested_error_boundaries_mixed_scenarios() {
    // Test complex scenarios with multiple nested ErrorBoundaries and mixed error states
}
```

### 3. Integration Tests for Theme System Integration

#### 3.1 Testing Theme System Integration for Default Error UI
```rust
#[wasm_bindgen_test]
fn test_error_boundary_theme_integration_default_ui() {
    // Test that the default error UI uses theme colors, typography, and spacing
}
```

#### 3.2 Testing Theme System Integration for Custom Fallback UI
```rust
#[wasm_bindgen_test]
fn test_error_boundary_theme_integration_custom_ui() {
    // Test that custom fallback UI can access and use theme values
}
```

#### 3.3 Testing Theme System Integration with Theme Updates
```rust
#[wasm_bindgen_test]
fn test_error_boundary_theme_integration_updates() {
    // Test that ErrorBoundary updates its styling when theme values change
}
```

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Testing Framework**: These tests will require a Yew component testing framework or custom testing utilities for DOM manipulation and event simulation.

2. **Error Component Creation**: We'll need to create test components that can deliberately throw errors to test the ErrorBoundary functionality.

3. **DOM Verification**: We'll need utilities to verify the actual HTML output and DOM structure of the rendered components.

4. **Theme System Integration**: We'll need to test with the actual theme system to ensure proper integration.

## Test File Structure

The integration tests will be implemented in:
- `shared_packages/web_core/tests/integration/components/error_boundary_integration_test.rs` - For integration tests with child components and nested ErrorBoundaries
- `shared_packages/web_core/tests/integration/components/error_boundary_theme_test.rs` - For theme system integration tests

The test modules will be added to `shared_packages/web_core/tests/integration/components/mod.rs`:
```rust
//! Integration tests for web core components

#[cfg(test)]
mod error_boundary_integration_test;
#[cfg(test)]
mod error_boundary_theme_test;
```

## Dependencies

The tests will depend on:
- `wasm_bindgen_test` for WASM testing
- `web_core::components::ErrorBoundary` for the component being tested
- Yew testing utilities for component rendering and DOM verification
- Theme system utilities for theme integration testing

## Future Considerations

As the ErrorBoundary component evolves, we should:
1. Add tests for new features and functionality
2. Expand test coverage for edge cases and error scenarios
3. Implement performance tests to ensure ErrorBoundary doesn't add significant overhead
4. Add cross-browser compatibility tests when running in browser environments
