# ErrorBoundary Component Testing Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of all testing plans for the ErrorBoundary component in the web_core package. It covers unit tests, integration tests, and accessibility tests to ensure the component is robust, functional, and accessible.

## Current State

The ErrorBoundary component currently has unit tests that cover:
- Component creation with default and custom properties
- BaseComponent trait implementation
- Property updates
- Error state management
- Fallback UI rendering
- Reset functionality

These tests are located in `shared_packages/web_core/tests/unit/components/error_boundary_test.rs`.

## Testing Plans

### 1. Unit Tests (Completed)
- Location: `shared_packages/web_core/tests/unit/components/error_boundary_test.rs`
- Status: Implemented and passing
- Coverage: Component creation, property handling, state management, BaseComponent implementation

### 2. Integration Tests (Planned)
- Document: `shared_packages/web_core/docs/architecture/error_boundary_integration_test_plan.md`
- Location: To be implemented in `shared_packages/web_core/tests/integration/components/`
- Coverage:
  - ErrorBoundary with various child components
  - Nested ErrorBoundary components
  - Theme system integration

### 3. Accessibility Tests (Planned)
- Document: `shared_packages/web_core/docs/architecture/error_boundary_accessibility_test_plan.md`
- Location: To be implemented in `shared_packages/web_core/tests/accessibility/components/`
- Coverage:
  - Screen reader error announcements
  - Keyboard navigation during error states
  - Focus management

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Integration Tests
1. Create integration test files:
   - `shared_packages/web_core/tests/integration/components/error_boundary_integration_test.rs`
   - `shared_packages/web_core/tests/integration/components/error_boundary_theme_test.rs`
2. Update `shared_packages/web_core/tests/integration/components/mod.rs` to include new test modules
3. Implement tests for ErrorBoundary with various child components
4. Implement tests for nested ErrorBoundary components
5. Implement tests for theme system integration

### Phase 2: Accessibility Tests
1. Create accessibility test file:
   - `shared_packages/web_core/tests/accessibility/components/error_boundary_accessibility_test.rs`
2. Update `shared_packages/web_core/tests/accessibility/components/mod.rs` to include new test module
3. Implement tests for screen reader error announcements
4. Implement tests for keyboard navigation during error states
5. Implement tests for focus management

## Testing Tools and Dependencies

### Current Dependencies
- `wasm_bindgen_test` for WASM testing
- `web_core::components::ErrorBoundary` and related types
- Yew framework for component testing

### Additional Dependencies Needed
- Yew testing utilities for DOM manipulation and event simulation
- Accessibility testing utilities for screen reader simulation and ARIA verification
- Theme system utilities for theme integration testing

## Quality Assurance

### Code Coverage Goals
- 100% coverage for existing functionality
- Comprehensive coverage for error scenarios
- Coverage for edge cases and boundary conditions

### Performance Considerations
- Tests should not significantly impact build times
- ErrorBoundary should have minimal performance overhead
- Memory usage should be optimized

### Accessibility Compliance
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- ARIA 1.1 specification adherence
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Test Scenarios
- Performance tests for error handling
- Cross-browser compatibility tests
- Mobile device testing
- Internationalization testing

### Continuous Integration
- Automated test execution on pull requests
- Code coverage reporting
- Accessibility testing in CI pipeline
- Performance regression detection

## Maintenance

### Test Maintenance Strategy
- Regular review of test coverage
- Updates to reflect component changes
- Refactoring of test code for maintainability
- Documentation updates for test procedures

### Monitoring
- Test failure rate tracking
- Performance metric monitoring
- Accessibility audit results
- Code coverage trend analysis

## Conclusion

The ErrorBoundary component has a solid foundation of unit tests and well-defined plans for integration and accessibility testing. Implementing these additional tests will ensure the component is robust, functional, and accessible to all users. The phased approach allows for systematic implementation while maintaining focus on quality and coverage.
