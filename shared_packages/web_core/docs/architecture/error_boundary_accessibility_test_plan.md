# ErrorBoundary Component Accessibility Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the accessibility test plan for the ErrorBoundary component in the web_core package. These tests will verify that the ErrorBoundary component is accessible to users with disabilities, including proper screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and focus management.

## Component Analysis

The ErrorBoundary component has the following accessibility considerations:
- Error messages should be announced by screen readers
- Focus should be managed properly when errors occur
- Keyboard navigation should work correctly during error states
- Proper ARIA attributes should be used for error states
- Error recovery should be accessible via keyboard

## Testing Approach

The accessibility tests will focus on:
1. Testing screen reader error announcements
2. Testing keyboard navigation during error states
3. Testing focus management when errors occur
4. Verifying proper ARIA attributes are used
5. Testing error recovery accessibility

## Test Cases

### 1. Accessibility Tests for Screen Reader Error Announcements

#### 1.1 Testing Initial Error Announcement
```rust
#[wasm_bindgen_test]
fn test_error_boundary_screen_reader_initial_announcement() {
    // Test that when an error occurs, screen readers announce the error
    // This would require accessibility testing utilities to capture screen reader output
}
```

#### 1.2 Testing Error Message Announcement
```rust
#[wasm_bindgen_test]
fn test_error_boundary_screen_reader_error_message() {
    // Test that specific error messages are announced by screen readers
    // The error message content should be properly announced
}
```

#### 1.3 Testing Error Recovery Announcement
```rust
#[wasm_bindgen_test]
fn test_error_boundary_screen_reader_recovery_announcement() {
    // Test that when an error is recovered, screen readers announce the recovery
    // This helps users understand that the error state has been resolved
}
```

### 2. Accessibility Tests for Keyboard Navigation During Error States

#### 2.1 Testing Focus Movement to Error UI
```rust
#[wasm_bindgen_test]
fn test_error_boundary_keyboard_focus_to_error_ui() {
    // Test that when an error occurs, focus moves to the error UI
    // This ensures keyboard users are aware of the error
}
```

#### 2.2 Testing Navigation Within Error UI
```rust
#[wasm_bindgen_test]
fn test_error_boundary_keyboard_navigation_within_error_ui() {
    // Test that keyboard users can navigate within the error UI
    // (e.g., to the "Try again" button)
}
```

#### 2.3 Testing Navigation After Error Recovery
```rust
#[wasm_bindgen_test]
fn test_error_boundary_keyboard_navigation_after_recovery() {
    // Test that after error recovery, focus returns to an appropriate location
    // This ensures a smooth user experience for keyboard users
}
```

### 3. Accessibility Tests for Focus Management

#### 3.1 Testing Focus Trapping During Error States
```rust
#[wasm_bindgen_test]
fn test_error_boundary_focus_management_trapping() {
    // Test that focus is trapped within the error UI during error states
    // This prevents keyboard users from tabbing to hidden content
}
```

#### 3.2 Testing Focus Restoration After Recovery
```rust
#[wasm_bindgen_test]
fn test_error_boundary_focus_management_restoration() {
    // Test that focus is properly restored after error recovery
    // This should return focus to a logical location in the UI
}
```

#### 3.3 Testing Focus Indicators
```rust
#[wasm_bindgen_test]
fn test_error_boundary_focus_indicators() {
    // Test that focus indicators are visible on interactive elements
    // within the error UI (e.g., the "Try again" button)
}
```

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Accessibility Testing Tools**: These tests will require accessibility testing utilities that can simulate screen readers, capture focus events, and verify ARIA attributes.

2. **DOM Verification**: We'll need utilities to verify that proper ARIA attributes are applied to elements and that the DOM structure supports accessibility.

3. **Keyboard Event Simulation**: We'll need to simulate keyboard events to test navigation and focus management.

4. **Screen Reader Simulation**: We'll need tools to capture and verify screen reader announcements.

## Test File Structure

The accessibility tests will be implemented in:
- `shared_packages/web_core/tests/accessibility/components/error_boundary_accessibility_test.rs` - For all accessibility tests

The test module will be added to `shared_packages/web_core/tests/accessibility/components/mod.rs`:
```rust
//! Accessibility tests for web core components

#[cfg(test)]
mod error_boundary_accessibility_test;
```

## Dependencies

The tests will depend on:
- `wasm_bindgen_test` for WASM testing
- `web_core::components::ErrorBoundary` for the component being tested
- Accessibility testing utilities for screen reader simulation and ARIA verification
- DOM manipulation utilities for focus and keyboard event simulation

## Accessibility Standards Compliance

These tests should verify compliance with:
- WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- ARIA 1.1 specifications
- Keyboard navigation best practices

## Future Considerations

As the ErrorBoundary component evolves, we should:
1. Add tests for new accessibility features
2. Expand test coverage for different types of assistive technologies
3. Implement automated accessibility testing as part of the CI pipeline
4. Add user testing with people who use assistive technologies
5. Regularly review and update tests based on evolving accessibility standards
