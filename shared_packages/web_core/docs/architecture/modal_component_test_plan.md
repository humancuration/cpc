# Modal Component Test Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive test plan for the refactored Modal component that implements the BaseComponent trait.

## Test Implementation Details

### Test Framework
- Use wasm-bindgen-test for browser-based testing
- Follow the same pattern as existing component tests (Button, Select, TextInput)

### Test Structure
```rust
use wasm_bindgen_test::*;
use web_core::components::{Modal, ModalProps};

wasm_bindgen_test_configure!(run_in_browser);

#[wasm_bindgen_test]
fn test_modal_creation_with_default_properties() {
    // Test implementation
}
```

### Mock Dependencies
- Mock any external dependencies if needed
- Use yew's testing utilities for component testing
- Create mock callbacks for event testing

## Test Coverage Goals

### Code Coverage
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage for the Modal component
- Ensure all branches and conditions are tested
- Cover both positive and negative test cases

### Functional Coverage
- Test all public methods (new, create, update_props, view)
- Test all property combinations
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Test error conditions and recovery
