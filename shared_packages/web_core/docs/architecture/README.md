# Web Core Architecture Improvements

This directory contains the architectural plans for major improvements to the web_core package. These plans outline enhancements to the component system, API client, theme system, and documentation strategy.

## Overview of Improvements

### 1. Component System Extensions
[Component Extensions Architecture](./component_extensions.md)

Extending the component system with new UI components and improving consistency across existing components.

**Key Improvements:**
- Making ErrorBoundary consistent with other components by implementing BaseComponent
- Adding new components: Select, TextArea, Form, and RadioButton
- Enhanced integration with the DesignSystem theme
- Improved accessibility and responsive design

### 2. API Client Enhancements
[API Client Enhancements Architecture](./api_client_enhancements.md)

Improving the API client with more robust features for modern web applications.

**Key Improvements:**
- Real implementation of batch request processing
- Enhanced caching mechanism with TTL and eviction policies
- Proper gRPC-web integration
- Comprehensive offline support strategy

### 3. Theme System Extensions
[Theme System Extensions Architecture](./theme_system_extensions.md)

Expanding the theme system to support modern UI/UX requirements.

**Key Improvements:**
- Dark mode support with automatic system detection
- Theme customization options and runtime switching
- Responsive design integration with breakpoints
- Improved theme management and composition

### 4. Documentation Strategy
[Documentation Strategy Architecture](./documentation_strategy.md)

Establishing comprehensive documentation standards for better maintainability and contributor onboarding.

**Key Improvements:**
- Rust code documentation standards
- Standardized component documentation format
- Comprehensive contributor guidelines
- Automated documentation quality checks
