# API Client Enhancements Architecture

This document outlines the architectural plans for enhancing the web_core API client with improved batching, caching, gRPC-web integration, and offline support.

## Task 1: Batch Request Processing Implementation

### Current State
The current batch request processing is a mock implementation that returns simulated success responses without actually sending requests to a server.

### Proposed Changes
Replace the mock implementation with a real batch processing system that can send multiple requests together to reduce network overhead.

### Implementation Plan
1. Implement a batch endpoint protocol that can handle multiple requests in a single HTTP request
2. Create a serialization format for combining multiple requests into a single payload
3. Implement deserialization for batch responses
4. Add proper error handling for individual requests within a batch
5. Maintain backward compatibility with existing API

### Batch Endpoint Protocol
```
POST /api/batch
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "requests": [
    {
      "id": "req1",
      "method": "GET",
      "endpoint": "/api/users/1",
      "headers": {}
    },
    {
      "id": "req2",
      "method": "POST",
      "endpoint": "/api/users",
      "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      "body": "{\"name\": \"John Doe\"}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Response Format
```
{
  "results": [
    {
      "request_id": "req1",
      "status_code": 200,
      "data": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe"
      }
    },
    {
      "request_id": "req2",
      "status_code": 201,
      "data": {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "John Doe"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Benefits
- Reduced network overhead
- Improved performance for multiple related requests
- Better resource utilization on the server side

## Task 2: Caching Mechanism Enhancement

### Current State
The current caching mechanism uses localStorage with simple key-value storage based on MD5 hashes of queries. This approach has limitations in terms of storage management and cache invalidation.

### Proposed Changes
Implement a more robust caching solution with the following features:
1. Cache expiration with TTL (Time To Live)
2. Cache size management with LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction
3. Cache invalidation strategies
4. Multiple storage backends (memory, IndexedDB)
5. Cache warming capabilities

### Implementation Plan
1. Create a CacheManager struct to handle caching operations
2. Implement different storage backends:
   - In-memory cache for fast access
   - IndexedDB for persistent storage with larger capacity
3. Add cache configuration options:
   - Maximum cache size
   - Default TTL values
   - Cache eviction policies
4. Implement cache warming functionality
5. Add cache statistics and monitoring

### CacheManager Structure
```rust
pub struct CacheManager {
    memory_cache: MemoryCache,
    indexeddb_cache: IndexedDBCache,
    config: CacheConfig,
}

pub struct CacheConfig {
    max_memory_entries: usize,
    max_disk_entries: usize,
    default_ttl_ms: u64,
    eviction_policy: EvictionPolicy,
}

pub enum EvictionPolicy {
    LRU,
    FIFO,
    TimeBased,
}
```

### Cache Entry Structure
```rust
pub struct CacheEntry<T> {
    data: T,
    timestamp: u64,
    ttl: Option<u64>,
    accessed_count: u32,
}
```

### Benefits
- More efficient cache utilization
- Better control over cache behavior
- Improved performance with faster access times
- Reduced storage overhead

## Task 3: gRPC-web Integration

### Current State
The gRPC client is currently mocked and doesn't make actual gRPC calls. It returns simulated responses instead.

### Proposed Changes
Implement a proper gRPC-web client that can communicate with gRPC services through the gRPC-web protocol.

### Implementation Plan
1. Integrate with a gRPC-web library that works with WebAssembly
2. Implement proper serialization/deserialization for gRPC messages
3. Add support for gRPC metadata and trailers
4. Implement streaming capabilities
5. Add proper error handling for gRPC status codes
6. Maintain backward compatibility with existing API

### gRPC-web Protocol Implementation
1. Use the official gRPC-web JavaScript library compiled to WebAssembly
2. Implement proper HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 translation
3. Handle gRPC message framing and compression
4. Support unary, server-streaming, and client-streaming RPCs

### Client Structure
```rust
pub struct GrpcWebClient {
    base_url: String,
    default_timeout: Option<u64>,
    interceptors: Vec<Box<dyn GrpcInterceptor>>,
}

pub trait GrpcInterceptor {
    fn intercept_request(&self, request: &mut HttpRequest);
    fn intercept_response(&self, response: &mut HttpResponse);
}
```

### Benefits
- Real-time communication with backend services
- Efficient binary serialization
- Strongly-typed interfaces
- Streaming capabilities

## Task 4: Offline Support Strategy

### Current State
Basic offline support exists through localStorage caching, but it's limited and doesn't handle complex scenarios.

### Proposed Changes
Implement a comprehensive offline support strategy with the following features:
1. Automatic offline detection
2. Request queuing during offline periods
3. Automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored
4. Conflict resolution for data modifications
5. Offline data persistence with IndexedDB
6. User notifications about offline status

### Implementation Plan
1. Implement connectivity monitoring
2. Create a request queue for offline operations
3. Add synchronization mechanisms for queued requests
4. Implement conflict resolution strategies
5. Add offline data storage with IndexedDB
6. Create user interface components for offline status

### Offline State Management
```rust
pub struct OfflineManager {
    is_offline: bool,
    request_queue: RequestQueue,
    data_store: OfflineDataStore,
    sync_manager: SyncManager,
}

pub enum OfflineEvent {
    GoingOffline,
    GoingOnline,
    SyncStarted,
    SyncCompleted,
    SyncFailed,
}
```

### Request Queue Implementation
1. Persistent storage of requests using IndexedDB
2. Request prioritization
3. Automatic retry mechanisms
4. Conflict detection and resolution

### Data Synchronization
1. Last-write-wins conflict resolution
2. User-mediated conflict resolution for complex cases
3. Incremental synchronization
4. Batch processing of changes

### Benefits
- Seamless user experience during network interruptions
- Data persistence across sessions
- Improved reliability in unreliable network conditions
- Better user experience on mobile devices
