# ErrorBoundary Component Enhancement Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed architectural plan for enhancing the ErrorBoundary component to properly implement the BaseComponent trait for consistency with other components in the library.

## Current State Analysis
The ErrorBoundary component currently implements both the Yew Component trait directly and the BaseComponent trait. However, the BaseComponent implementation has issues - it doesn't properly integrate with the Yew component lifecycle and creates an infinite loop by wrapping itself.

## Proposed Enhancement
Fix the BaseComponent implementation to properly delegate to the Yew Component implementation while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Component Structure

### ErrorBoundaryProps
```rust
#[derive(Properties, PartialEq, Clone)]
pub struct ErrorBoundaryProps {
    /// Common properties for all components
    #[prop_or_default]
    pub common: CommonProps,
    
    /// The content to display when there's no error
    #[prop_or_default]
    pub children: Children,
    
    /// Callback when an error occurs
    #[prop_or_default]
    pub on_error: Callback<WebError>,
    
    /// Custom fallback UI to display when an error occurs
    #[prop_or_default]
    pub fallback: Option<Html>,
}
```

### ErrorBoundaryState
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct ErrorBoundaryState {
    /// Whether an error has occurred
    has_error: bool,
    
    /// The error message
    error_message: Option<String>,
}
```

### ErrorBoundary Component
```rust
pub struct ErrorBoundary {
    /// Component properties
    props: ErrorBoundaryProps,
    
    /// Component state
    state: ErrorBoundaryState,
}
```

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Fix BaseComponent Implementation
The current BaseComponent implementation creates an infinite loop. We need to fix it to properly delegate to the Yew Component implementation:

```rust
impl BaseComponent for ErrorBoundary {
    type Properties = ErrorBoundaryProps;
    
    fn create(props: &Self::Properties) -> Self {
        Self::new(props.clone())
    }
    
    fn update_props(&mut self, props: Self::Properties) {
        self.props = props;
    }
    
    fn view(&self) -> Html {
        // Create a Yew component instance and render it
        // This requires a different approach - we'll need to use a wrapper
        // or restructure how the component works
    }
}
```

### 2. Restructure Component Architecture
Since ErrorBoundary needs to work with Yew's error boundary mechanism, we'll need to:

1. Keep the Yew Component implementation as the primary interface
2. Provide BaseComponent methods that work with the Yew Component
3. Ensure both interfaces work seamlessly together

### 3. Maintain Backward Compatibility
All existing API should continue to work without changes.

## Integration with Existing Theme System
- Use theme colors for error states
- Use theme typography for error messages
- Use theme spacing for margins and padding

## Accessibility Considerations
- Proper ARIA attributes for error states
- Focus management when error occurs
- Clear error messages for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support for error recovery

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test error catching functionality
- Test fallback UI rendering
- Test error callback execution
- Test reset functionality
- Test BaseComponent implementation

### Integration Tests
- Test ErrorBoundary with various child components
- Test nested ErrorBoundary components
- Test integration with theme system

### Accessibility Tests
- Test screen reader error announcements
- Test keyboard navigation during error states
- Test focus management

## Documentation Updates
- Update component documentation with BaseComponent usage examples
- Add examples for both Yew Component and BaseComponent interfaces
- Document accessibility features
- Update theming integration guide

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Analysis and Design (Completed)
- Analyze current implementation
- Identify issues with BaseComponent implementation
- Design solution architecture

### Phase 2: Implementation
- Fix BaseComponent implementation
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Implement theme integration
- Add accessibility features

### Phase 3: Testing
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Accessibility testing

### Phase 4: Documentation
- Update component documentation
- Add usage examples
- Document best practices

## Performance Considerations
- Minimal overhead for error boundary functionality
- Efficient state management
- Proper cleanup of resources

## Error Handling
- Graceful handling of errors in the error boundary itself
- Clear error messages for developers
- Proper logging of errors
