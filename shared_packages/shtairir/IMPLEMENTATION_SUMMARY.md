### 3. Enhanced Error Handling (`shared_packages/shtairir_core/src/error.rs`)
- Added new error types for execution, memory, and planning
- Extended `ShtairirError` enum with `Execution`, `Memory`, and `Planning` variants
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing error handling

### 4. Parallel Execution Planning (`shared_packages/shtairir_execution/src/planning.rs`)
- Implemented `ExecutionPlanner` for creating optimized execution plans
- Developed `DependencyAnalyzer` for graph dependency analysis
- Created `ExecutionPlan` and `ExecutionStage` for structured execution
- Added resource-aware planning with `ResourceRequirements` and `ResourceLimits`
- Implemented optimization levels (None, Basic, Balanced, Aggressive)

## Integration and Compatibility

All components are designed to work together seamlessly:

- Core blocks can be composed using various patterns
