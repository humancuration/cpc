# Task Manager Architecture

## Overview
The Task Manager application follows hexagonal architecture principles with a focus on team collaboration and integration with other CPC applications. The system is divided into three main layers:

### Domain Layer
- Contains core business logic and entities
- Defines task management rules and validations

### Application Layer
- Orchestrates domain objects
- Handles use cases (task creation, assignment, etc.)
- Manages integration with external systems

### Infrastructure Layer
- PostgreSQL repository implementations
- GraphQL API endpoints
- Bevy UI components
- Integration with Social and Calendar apps

## Key Modules
1. `task_core` - Domain models and business rules
2. `task_service` - Application services
3. `task_repository` - PostgreSQL data access
4. `task_api` - GraphQL interface
5. `task_ui` - Bevy visualization components
6. `task_integration` - Connections to other CPC apps

## Performance Considerations
- Use Sled for local caching of frequently accessed tasks
- Implement real-time updates via GraphQL subscriptions
- Optimize dependency graph rendering with Bevy ECS
