# Social Integration Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the social integration features for the CPC platform.

## Overview

The social integration crate provides functionality for integrating social features across CPC apps, including:
- Unified feeds
- Cross-posting

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Social Integration Crate

A new crate `cpc-social-integration` was created with the following structure:

#### Domain Layer
- `post`: Unified post model and related types (AppSource, PostMetadata, EngagementMetrics, etc.)
- `social_event`: Social events for tracking user interactions (PostCreated, CommentCreated, PostVoted, etc.)

#### Application Layer
- `social_integration_service`: Main service for integrating social features
- `tip_service`: Service for handling social tipping between users (DEPRECATED - moved to wallet package)
- `feed_service`: Service for generating unified feeds (chronological and algorithmic)

#### GraphQL Layer
- `schema`: GraphQL schema definition and root objects
- `queries`: GraphQL query implementations
- `mutations`: GraphQL mutation implementations
- `types`: GraphQL type definitions
- `error`: Custom GraphQL error types

#### Infrastructure Layer
- `repositories`: In-memory repository implementation for unified posts
- `clients`: Clients for integrating with Allat and Yapper apps

### 2. Wallet Crate

The wallet functionality was extracted from the finance app into a separate `cpc_wallet` crate:
- Domain models for Wallet and WalletTransaction
- Application service for wallet operations (add/subtract/transfer dabloons)
- Primitive types for Money and Currency

### 3. OAuth Integration

Twitter OAuth support was added to the existing OAuth2 crate:
- Twitter provider adapter implementation
- Twitter feature flag in Cargo.toml

### 4. App Updates

#### Allat App
- Updated Cargo.toml to use cpc_wallet instead of direct finance dependency
- Added social_integration dependency

#### Yapper App
- Updated OAuth handlers to support Twitter provider
- Updated Cargo.toml to use cpc_wallet instead of direct finance dependency
- Added social_integration dependency

## Testing

- Unit tests for all domain models
- Integration tests for repository implementations
- Example usage demonstration

## Usage

The social integration crate can be used to:
1. Create unified posts from any social app
2. Process social events for analytics and tracking
3. Generate unified feeds for users
4. Integrate with existing social apps (Allat and Yapper)
5. Query tip transactions via GraphQL API

## Next Steps

1. Implement database repositories for production use
2. Add real OAuth integration with external providers
3. Implement cross-posting functionality
4. Add more sophisticated feed algorithms
5. Implement data sharing consent workflows
6. Add integration tests for the GraphQL API with real services
