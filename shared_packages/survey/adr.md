# ADR: Survey Module Architecture

## Status
Proposed

## Context
We need a reusable survey system that integrates with our review system. Surveys should support:
- 0-5 star ratings with half-star increments
- Optional text responses
- Questionnaire-style detailed responses
- Integration with reviews where reviewers can optionally complete surveys

## Decision
We'll implement a survey package with:
1. **Survey core components**:
   - `Survey` struct with ID, title, description, questions
   - Multiple question types (StarRating, TextResponse, etc.)
   - `SurveyResponse` struct to store answers

2. **Review integration**:
   - Add `survey_response` field to existing Review struct
   - Validation rules for survey responses
   - Methods to attach/detach surveys from reviews

3. **Additional features**:
   - Survey template system
   - Statistical analysis helpers
   - Serialization/deserialization support

### Integration Points
1. **Review System**:
   ```rust
   pub struct Review<T: Entity> {
       // Existing fields...
       pub survey_response: Option<SurveyResponse>
   }
   ```
   - Validation will check survey responses when present
   
2. **Analytics Engine**:
   - Add survey analysis methods:
     - `analyze_survey_responses()`
     - `plot_survey_trends()`

## Consequences
- Positive: Reusable survey system across apps
- Positive: Enhanced review capabilities
- Negative: Added complexity to review validation
- Risk: Performance impact with large surveys

# ADR-002: Visualization Integration

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Survey data needs to be visualized for better understanding and presentation. We need to integrate visualization capabilities into the survey system without adding heavy dependencies.

## Decision
We'll implement a visualization module with:
1. **Lightweight plotting functions** using plotters crate
2. **Common visualization types**:
   - Histograms for numerical data distribution
   - Heatmaps for correlation matrices
   - Word clouds for text responses
   - Trend lines for time-series data
3. **Error handling** with custom VisualizationError type
4. **Binary output** for easy integration with web services

## Consequences
- Positive: Enhanced data presentation capabilities
- Positive: Self-contained visualization module
- Negative: Added dependency on plotters crate
- Risk: Potential performance impact with large datasets

# ADR-003: Template System

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Creating surveys from scratch is time-consuming. We need a template system to allow users to create surveys based on pre-defined templates.

## Decision
We'll implement a template system with:
1. **SurveyTemplate struct** with metadata and versioning
2. **QuestionTemplate struct** for reusable question configurations
3. **Template service** with functions to:
   - Create templates from existing surveys
   - Retrieve templates by ID
   - Version templates with new updates
4. **Template storage** using existing data persistence layer

## Consequences
- Positive: Faster survey creation
- Positive: Consistent survey designs
- Negative: Added complexity to the system
- Risk: Template versioning conflicts

# ADR-004: Advanced Statistical Methods

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Basic statistical analysis is insufficient for comprehensive survey insights. We need to implement advanced statistical methods for deeper data analysis.

## Decision
We'll enhance the analysis module with:
1. **Correlation analysis** between numerical questions
2. **Trend analysis** over time periods
3. **Sentiment analysis** for text responses using NLP
4. **Comparative analysis** between demographic groups
5. **Performance optimizations** with caching and sampling
6. **Error handling** with custom AnalysisError type

## Consequences
- Positive: Deeper insights from survey data
- Positive: More comprehensive analysis capabilities
- Negative: Added complexity to analysis module
- Risk: Performance impact with large datasets
