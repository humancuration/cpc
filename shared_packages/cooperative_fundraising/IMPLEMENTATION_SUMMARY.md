## Domain Layer

### Core Entities

1. **Campaign** - Represents fundraising campaigns of various types:
   - CooperativeMembership (participation-based)
   - PureDonation (external needs)
   - RegCF/RegA/RegD (regulatory compliance)

2. **Contribution** - Represents contributions to campaigns:
   - Monetary contributions (for donation campaigns)
   - Volunteer actions (for all campaign types)

3. **Membership** - Represents cooperative membership shares with strict 1-per-person enforcement

### Key Design Principles

- Strict separation between internal community participation and external monetary needs
- Database-level enforcement of 1 membership share per person
- Volunteer hours have no monetary value within the federation
- All labor within the federation has no cash value

## Application Layer

### Services

1. **CampaignService** - Manages campaign lifecycle (creation, activation, completion)
2. **ContributionService** - Processes monetary and volunteer contributions
3. **MembershipService** - Manages cooperative membership shares

### Integrations

1. **CpayIntegration** - Processes external monetary transactions
2. **WalletIntegration** - Manages fund allocation and transparency
3. **SkillVolunteeringAdapter** - Links volunteer contributions to verified opportunities

### Validation

- **ContributionValidator** - Ensures contributions match campaign types and requirements

## Infrastructure Layer

### Data Access

- **PostgresCampaignRepository** - Campaign data persistence
- **PostgresContributionRepository** - Contribution data persistence
- **PostgresMembershipRepository** - Membership data persistence

### Interface

- **CooperativeFundraisingServiceImpl** - gRPC service implementation

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

1. `campaigns` - Main campaign information
2. `membership_requirements` - Requirements for membership campaigns
3. `donation_campaigns` - Details for donation campaigns
4. `contributions` - Individual contributions (monetary or volunteer)
5. `user_shares` - Membership shares with database-level constraints

### Key Constraints

- Database-level exclusion constraint enforcing 1 membership share per person
- Foreign key relationships ensuring data integrity
- Type-specific validation through constraint triggers

## Protocol

### gRPC Service

Defined in `proto/cooperative_fundraising.proto` with services for:
- Campaign management (create, get, list, update, delete)
- Membership management (join cooperative, get membership)
- Contribution management (make monetary, record volunteer, list)
- Campaign status management (activate, complete)

## Integration Points

### External Systems

1. **cpay** - External payment processing with compliance verification
2. **wallet** - Fund management and transparency reporting
3. **skill_volunteering** - Volunteer opportunity verification

## Testing

### Test Suite

1. **Domain Tests** - Validate business logic and entity behavior
2. **Integration Tests** - Test service interactions (with mocks)

## Compliance Features

### Regulatory Support

- Dedicated campaign types for SEC regulations (Reg CF, Reg A, Reg D)
- External use case requirements for all monetary donations
- Full audit trail through wallet and cpay integrations

### Cooperative Principles

- One person, one vote through membership share constraints
- Labor ≠ Currency principle through volunteer hour tracking without monetary valuation
- Transparency through fund allocation tracking

## Key Implementation Details

### Membership Enforcement

- Database-level exclusion constraint ensures 1 membership share per person
- Service layer validation provides additional safety checks
- gRPC interface returns clear error messages for membership attempts

### Contribution Validation

- Type-specific validation ensures monetary contributions only for donation campaigns
- Volunteer contributions allowed for all campaign types
- Integration with skill_volunteering system verifies opportunity validity

### Fund Management

- All monetary transactions processed through cpay for compliance
- Funds tracked through wallet system for transparency
- External use cases required for all donation campaigns

## Future Enhancements

### Regulatory Features

- Full implementation of Reg CF/Reg A/Reg D compliance requirements
- Automated reporting for regulatory filings
- Enhanced verification workflows for disputed contributions

### Community Features

- Enhanced dashboard for campaign tracking
- Social sharing of volunteer contributions
- Recognition systems for community participation

## Conclusion

The Cooperative Fundraising System successfully implements a community-driven fundraising platform that maintains cooperative principles while providing necessary interfaces with external financial systems. The system's architecture ensures scalability, compliance, and alignment with the CPC platform's values.
